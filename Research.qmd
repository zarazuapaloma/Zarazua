### INVESTIGATING EFFECTS OF NEUTROPHIL-LIKE CELLS (NLCs) BY NEW DEVELOPING METALS

**Department of Biological Sciences|California State Polytechnic University, Pomona**

## Abstract

The demand for prosthetics has gradually increased with the need for implants and the advancements in technology, making them more accessible to the growing population in the United States. Prosthetic recipients have become increasingly younger over time, resulting in a longer duration of implant use among this demographic. The extended implant duration within the physiological environment in the body can result in corrosion of the metal alloy. Metal debris resulting from the corrosion can induce an inflammatory response that can lead to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption around the implant. Bone resorption is the process of bone tissue dissolving through the action of specialized bone remodeling cells called osteoclasts. Monocytes and macrophages are precursors for osteoclast cells. One of the key signals in osteoclast formation is the activation of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa  (RANK) on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells, by RANK ligand (RANKL) on other cells, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. This ligand plays a crucial role by binding to the RANK receptors found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages, promoting their differentiation into osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts will attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid that degrades the bone. When this phenomenon occurs on the periphery, it causes osteolytic loosening. Different cell types are involved in the activation of bone resorption, including osteoclasts, macrophages, and fibroblasts, but it is not entirely known how neutrophils play a role in this process. Neutrophils are one of the first responders of the immune system in the presence of an antigen. They secrete many of the same cytokines as macrophages and fibroblasts that aid in osteoclast activation. It is unknown whether neutrophils detect metal debris resulting from implant corrosion or whether they are induced into an inflammatory response. This study seeks to provide more knowledge on neutrophil function in the presence of new metal alloys that could potentially be used for prosthetic implants. HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) were exposed to titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V), and novel titanium-boron alloys. Upon exposure, phagocytosis activity was analyzed along with inflammatory cytokine secretion using a cytometric bead array, and expression of NLC RANKL by flow cytometry. This is a comparative analysis of a series of metal alloys to determine which of them activates neutrophils the least, potentially making for a more biocompatible metal.


## Chapter 1: Introduction
### A. Prosthesis 

A prosthesis is an artificial device used to replace a missing or no longer functional body part (Figure 1). Reasons why many people obtain a prosthesis are due to amputations, age, injuries, and diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Prostheses nowadays can be made from a variety of metal alloys that each have benefits and disadvantages. 


### B. History of Prosthesis

Prostheses have been used for a large portion of history. It is unknown when the first prosthetic was created, but the oldest known prosthesis that has been identified is from ancient Egypt. One toe was made from papier-mache but would not bend, while another toe was created using wood and leather (Figure 2).  It was believed that prosthetics were created for cosmetic purposes rather than functionality. In Italy, at approximately 300 B.C., a prosthetic leg was made from bronze, hollowed wood, and leather straps. During the 16th century, the first functional prosthetic was created for soldiers who were coming off the battlefield1. During the American Civil War in 1860, the high number of amputees from the war caused a spike in prosthetic patents to quadruple. Figure 3 displays an artificial leg used by soldiers during the American Civil War. Throughout the 15th and 19th centuries, France and Switzerland began making prosthetics that were more functional by using cables, gears, and springs. Later in the 1900s, manufacturers were producing more functional prosthetics with more artificial materials like plastic, aluminum, titanium, and silicone to make the products lightweight and durable. 

### C.	Metals Used in Prosthesis  

As technology has advanced through the ages, more alterations have been made for patients that aid in users’ needs, such as pain reduction, mobility, and independence2.  Availability, cost, mechanical properties, and longevity must be part of the criteria for a successful prosthetic implant. Today, implant prosthetics are being made using materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and cobalt chrome 3. All metals used present a unique outcome due to the corrosion properties of the prosthetic after being implanted into a warm, wet, and salty environment, compounded by the natural movement of the body. Corrosion of such metal alloys may result in further complications for the user. These may include an inflammatory response that causes bone erosion, prosthetic failure, and the user receiving an entirely new prosthetic implant. Certain standards are required to establish a biocompatible metal. When metals are implanted into the patient, their positive charge is attracted to the negative charge of chloride ions in the human body. The chloride ions will pull titanium or iron or any positively charged metal out of the implant, leading to the accumulation of wear debris in the body. The free metal ions can also create harmful effects in surrounding tissues, including DNA damage. Moreover, high concentrations of metal ions have been shown to induce cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, etc., while minimal levels of metal concentration can initiate cytokine release. 

Titanium (Ti) is widely utilized for its exceptional biocompatibility, which significantly minimizes the risks of adverse reactions post-implantation surgery3. Upon exposure to physiological conditions, titanium forms a stable oxide layer on its surface, contributing to the enhancement of biocompatibility and promoting integration with surrounding tissues 4. The metal also exhibits favorable mechanical properties such as high strength and stiffness, making it suitable for load-bearing biomedical applications. The oxidation process is a key factor in its success as a biomaterial. However, titanium alone is relatively softer compared to titanium alloys.  Titanium alloys, such as 90% Titanium- 6% Aluminum- 4% Vanadium (Ti6Al4V) are commonly used for prosthetic implants (Figure 4). For this alloy, once the superoxide layer is broken, the metal ions are attracted to the Cl ions, and the Ti ions escape through the fracture and into the body. The Ti ions bind to oxygen, creating TiO2 debris, which causes an immune response.(Figure 5). Newer titanium alloys may be a better option, analyzing them for more strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility overall. 

Stainless steel is a metal alloy composed of chromium, nickel, and small amounts of  molybdenum 5 6. This alloy possesses a high resistance to corrosion 7 and is commonly used in surgical implants8,9 (Figure 6). It has low strength and ductility but can be very expensive to make.

 Cobalt Chrome is a very toxic metal alloy, but is also commonly used in medical implants due to its low chemical inertness and high corrosion resistance (Figure 7)10. The degradation through wear corrosion releases ions that can result in elevated levels of cobalt chrome in the body. Cobalt is highly toxic when concentrated at 7-10µg/L 3 or above.  The wear can become toxic, creating an immune response and leading to osteolytic loosening. It affects the immune system, is a carcinogen, induces cardiotoxicity, and causes mutagenesis.
 
### D. Demand for Prosthetics 

Prosthetic implants are steadily increasing in demand as the population ages and people’s bodies require structural reinforcement or replacements. The increasing demand is due to traumatic and non-traumatic causes of limb loss, and complications with current prosthetic implants. Current estimates indicate that 1.9 million individuals in the United States live with limb loss. This number is expected to double to 3.6 million people by 2050 11. Out of the growing patient population, only 15% of individuals with amputations currently have access to prosthetic devices 12, highlighting a disparity in healthcare availability for individuals with amputations. 

The underlying causes of limb loss are diverse, but can be categorized as trauma, cancer, infections, and vascular diseases 13,14. Among the complications associated with limb loss, bone resorption is one of the biological challenges that limits the longevity of prosthetic implants. Patients who receive prosthetic joint implants frequently require revision surgeries, replacement of the prosthetic, when bone resorption weakens the implant’s support. Current statistics show that over 10% of the patients who acquire total joint replacements require revision surgeries due to implant failures caused by osteolytic loosening15. These statistics demonstrate the downsides of metals that induce immune stimulation, which leads to bone degradation and shortened prosthetic implant longevity for patients.  

### E.	Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
An arthroplasty is a surgical procedure performed to restore the joint using a prosthetic implant (Figure 8). The procedure is intended to restore the function of the joint by improving mobility, reducing pain, and enhancing quality of life for patients. Among all prosthetic implant surgeries, total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are the most common prosthetic implants required by patients. Patients who undergo the procedure experience a relief from joint pain and functional improvement as long as the implant does not corrode. Weight-bearing implants such as these typically last approximately 15 years. 
In a total hip arthroplasty (THA), the damaged or diseased portion of the hip joint is replaced with artificial components. It is predicted that by the year 2030, there will be over 635,000 procedures performed annually in the United States16. Similarly, a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure where the damaged part of the knee joint is replaced with artificial implants. By the year 2030, more than 1.26 million TKA procedures will be conducted annually in the United States16,17. Recent Medicare projections predict that by 2040, THAs are expected to exceed 719,000 annually, while TKAs over 1.22 million17. By the year 2060,  it is expected that 2 million THAs and 3 million TKA procedures will be performed annually17.

Although primary arthroplasty procedures are successful, there are still complications that remain a challenge. Some of the most common complications following THA or TKA include biofilm formation on the metal, aseptic loosening, dislocation of the implant, infection, osteolysis from wear debris, sciatic nerve injuries, and insufficient bone bonding between bone and prosthesis 5. These complications often require revision surgeries, carrying a higher risk, higher cost, more physical therapy, and possibly associated with less favorable outcomes compared to the primary implant. Medicare projections show that the number of revision procedures is lower in number than primary procedures, with their rates still being substantial. It is expected that by the year 2040, about 43,5000 cases of THA revision surgeries will occur annually, and TKA revision surgeries will exceed nearly 115,000 cases per year 16. Correspondingly, by the year 2060, it is expected to nearly reach 62,000 cases of THA revision surgeries annually, while about 287,000 cases of THA revision surgeries would occur per year (Figure 9)16. 

These projections demonstrate the increasing demand for primary arthroplasties due to an aging population and the burden of added revision arthroplasties because of implant failure. This indicates a critical reason to find a durable biocompatible material that will prevent prosthetic failure, reduce the risk of revision surgeries, and enhance implant longevity.

### F.	Cost of Prosthetic Implants

The cost of prosthetic implants can be a burden to most patients, especially those who have no access to health care. Studies show that physical hip implants may range between $2,392 - $12,65118 while physical knee implants cost between $1,797- $12,093 18. Total joint arthroplasties are one of the largest expenditures in health care during the year with 1.5 million cases happening in the United States 18. 

The expenditure for the total arthroplasty procedures is actively rising throughout the years.  Statistics show that the cost for a primary TKA or THA with no complications is approximately $39,927- $195,264 19. However, when revision surgeries occur, the costs increase significantly, ranging from $58,967- $247,715, not including any complications that may occur during the procedure 19. One of the main challenges with the cost is the lack of transparency between physicians who did not have the accurate knowledge of the prices from different implant options. Many orthopedic providers believed that the more expensive implants had higher clinical value than the less expensive options. The lack of knowledge and awareness may contribute to the heightened healthcare spending. With the cost of these procedures, many low-income or uninsured individuals are avoiding the surgery, which leads them to more pain and less mobility. 

### G.	Complications with Prosthetic Implants

Complications that may arise with the use of prosthetic implants include both mechanical failures and biological responses, often resulting in implant failure requiring revision surgery. This occurs when the first implant stops working properly, and an additional surgery is required to replace the failing implant and insert a new one. Revision surgeries are common with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties, where metal debris can lead to implant failure, pseudotumor,  and soft tissue necrosis20. Inflammatory responses also occur in the presence of implants, where macrophages, fibroblasts, and neutrophils appear at the site of infection to fight off foreign invaders. This reaction contributes to osteolytic loosening, one of the primary biological causes of implant failure21. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is reported in roughly 0.5-2% of primary hip and knee arthroplasties, with incidence rising 4-5% after revision procedures and reaching as high as 20% among revision indications22,23. Early stage infections are most common within the first two years, where reported rates range from 0.8-2.1% for primary hip arthroplasty24. The infection rates underscore the clinical burden of PJI and its contribution to the need for revision surgery. 

Mechanical complications present a challenge among prosthetic implants. Corrosion can occur at implant sites where repetitive movement may cause the prosthetic to rub against the bone, releasing metal debris particles that spread into surrounding tissues20. Colonization of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis may also occur as a complication that can lead to infection and in some cases, revision surgery (Figure 10)25. 

With new advancements, the amount of wear debris production in the body has reduced and has increased overall implant longevity. Nevertheless, complication rates remain higher in revision arthroplasties compared to primary procedures, especially in TKA, where vascular and infection-related risks are elevated26.  

### H.	Osteolytic loosening 

Osteolysis is the process of bone loss resulting from an immune response that induces osteoclast activity, leading to bone resorption. This reaction occurs when the prosthetic implant creates wear debris, and the resulting metal particles accumulate in the tissue. Osteolytic loosening, also known as aseptic loosening, occurs as an outcome of osteolysis where the implant interfaces with the bone. When osteoclasts break down bone tissue around the prosthetic implant, that bone resorption weakens the bone-implant interface progressively over time (Figure 11). Osteolytic loosening is mainly driven by chronic bone resorption, a biological response to long-term exposure to the wear particles from the implant. It is the most common cause of implant failure, leading to increased revision surgeries27.

During osteolysis, osteoclasts degrade bone tissue and release the minerals from the bone, and deposit them into the patient’s body27,28. Osteoblasts, the counterparts to osteoclasts, will then attempt to reconstruct the worn-away bone tissue. However, complications arise when the balance between bone resorption and formation is disrupted. The activation of osteoclasts is regulated through the RANK—RANKL signaling pathway (Figure 12)29. Osteoclast precursors (OCPs) originating from the monocyte lineage express the receptor RANK, which binds to RANKL expressed by osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cells27,30. RANKL exists in two biologically active forms: a membrane-bound form and a soluble form, which differ in both structure and function. Membrane-bound RANKL (mRANKL) is expressed on the cell surface as a type II transmembrane protein and requires direct cell-cell contact to activate RANK on osteoclast precursors. This form provides strong, localized, and sustained signaling that is considered the primary driver of osteoclast differentiation and activation. In contrast, soluble RANKL (sRANKL) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane-bound RANKL and lacks the transmembrane region. As a diffusible ligand, sRANKL can act at a distance and contribute to broader inflammatory signaling; however, it generally induces weaker and less sustained osteoclastogenic signaling compared to membrane-bound RANKL. The balance between these two forms of RANKL influences the magnitude and spatial regulation of osteoclast activation, particularly within the localized inflammatory microenvironment surrounding prosthetic implants.

While RANK-RANKL signaling is essential for osteoclastogenesis, additional co-stimulatory and independent pathways significantly modulate osteoclast activation, particularly in inflammatory contexts such as periprosthetic osteolysis. Macrophage - Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF), acting through its receptor, is required for osteoclast precursor survival and proliferation but cannot alone induce terminal differentiation31. Immunoreceptor signaling through ITAM-containing adaptors (DAP12, FcRy) provides necessary co-stimulatory signals that activate calcium-dependent NFATc1, the master transcription factor for osteoclast formation31. Importantly, pro-inflammatory cytokines can bypass or amplify RANKL signaling: TNF-α directly induces osteoclast differentiation independently of RANKL and synergizes with permissive RANKL levels through shared NF-κB and JNK pathways. IL-1ß can mediate osteoclastogenesis in c-Fos-expressing precursors and contributes substantially to TNF-α-induced bone resorption in inflammatory arthritis. The chemokine IL-8 acts directly on osteoclast precursors through CXCR1 receptors to stimulate differentiation independently of RANKL. More recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been shown to induce rapid osteoclast formation via TLR4 activation, representing a RANKL-independent mechanism relevant in acute inflammatory responses31. These alternative pathways converge on common downstream effectors (NF-κB, c-Fos, NFATc1) and are particularly active in the cytokine-rich periprosthetic environment, where macrophage-derived TNF-α, fibroblast-derived RANKL, and neutrophil-released mediators collectively drive excessive osteoclast activation and bone loss. 

This interaction is enhanced by the parathyroid hormone, driving the differentiation of OCPs into mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts30,32. The mature osteoclasts will migrate to the bone surface to form a specialized sealed zone called the resorption lacuna. Then, osteoclast proton pumps secrete hydrogen ions, causing acidification that will begin the breakdown of bone mineral, hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)). Additionally, osteoclasts secrete proteolytic enzymes, such as cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAP), which degrade the collagen and organic components of bone 33. The resulting mineral ions and collagen fragments are then internalized by the osteoclast through endocytosis, transported through the cell, and released into the bloodstream as waste products. This process of demineralization and enzymatic digestion enables osteoclasts to resorb significant amounts of bone tissue. In a periprosthetic environment, when the mechanism is amplified by the persistent presence of wear debris, it leads to pathologic bone loss. Over time, the persistent activation of osteoclasts and bone resorption weakens the bone-implant interface, resulting in osteolytic loosening and implant failure. 

### I . Cells involved in bone resorption

Macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and lymphocytes are involved in bone resorption (Figure 14). Together, these diverse cell types create a dynamic micro-environment in which bone remodeling is tightly coordinated. The first interaction is primarily mediated through the stimulation of macrophages and their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines27. A pro-inflammatory cytokine is a type of small signaling protein released by immune cells in response to infection, injury, or inflammation. During bone resorption, diverse cells interact to coordinate bone remodeling, such as macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and neutrophils. Osteoblasts are specialized mesenchymal cells that form new bone tissue; they also produce RANKL and induce osteoclast formation. Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells derived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage. 

Macrophages are monocytes produced from the bone marrow that differentiate into mature macrophages and are recruited into tissues during homeostasis, inflammation, or infection (Figure 13) 34.  The primary functions of macrophages include the process of phagocytosis, immune regulation, and tissue-specific roles. Macrophages can engulf pathogens, apoptotic cells, and debris through phagocytosis 35. Additionally, these cells act as sentinel cells, which act as a first line of immune defense against pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). They release cytokines and other inflammatory mediators to signal other cells to the site of the threat. Macrophages also have tissue-specific roles in the bones, liver, adipose tissue, and brain34. These cells serve as osteoclast precursors (OCPs), which can differentiate into mature osteoclasts through a cytokine and a receptor-ligand interaction: Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL). Osteoblastic cells and stromal cells both produce M-CSF and RANKL, which bind to their receptors on OCPs. M-CSF binds to the c-fms receptor, while RANKL binds to its receptor RANK28,30,33. Through these pathways, mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts are formed28,30. The osteoclasts then attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsin K to degrade the bone28,29.

Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that are primarily responsible for maintaining and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Additionally, they provide structural support, regulate tissue repair, and act as signaling niche cells by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors36,37. Fibroblasts are also involved with fibrosis, the formation of fibrous connective tissue in response to injury, inflammation, or disease38. In response to injuries, fibroblasts can differentiate into myofibroblasts, which can actively remodel tissue38. In the bone resorption process, aggressive fibroblasts, known as prosthesis loosening fibroblasts (PLFs), have the ability to degrade the bone directly without the usage of osteoclasts, and use proteolytic enzymes like cathepsins to break the bone down36. Fibroblasts are also able to influence osteoclast-mediated bone resorption through two pathways: through RANKL production or pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Fibroblasts release RANKL, which binds to the RANK receptors on osteoclast precursors, such as monocytes/macrophages, to drive osteoclast differentiation39.  Their differentiation and activation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts is critical in initiating bone loss. Fibroblasts also have growth factors that play their own role in bone regeneration and osteogenesis. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), also known as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and FGF-β,  is able to enhance osteoblast proliferation, but excess FGF-2 may impair mineralization38.  FGF9 promotes angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessels stemming from existing ones, and osteoclast recruitment during bone healing. FGF18 stimulates osteoblast differentiation and supports bone repair40. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-⍺ all promote osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, intensifying the bone degradation27,41,42. 

### J. Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines 

The pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in bone resorption are IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF⍺. These four cytokines are all released by macrophages, fibroblasts, and neutrophils (Figure 15). 

IL-1 or interleukin-1 acts to increase vascular permeability, recruit leukocytes, induce fever, stimulate myeloid cell production, and regulate innate immunity. IL-1 is produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblast cell lineages, and neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli43,4445. IL-1 is able to stimulate osteoclast differentiation and activation by upregulating RANKL expression on osteoblasts and stromal cells42,44. It enhances osteoclast survival and bone resorbing activity.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine with diverse roles in inflammation, hematopoiesis,  immune responses, and host defense46,47. IL-6 can indirectly enhance osteoclast formation with the upregulation of RANKL on osteoblastic/stromal cells and fibroblasts31,47,48. By upregulating RANKL with the IL-6/sIL-6R, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, osteoclast precursors can promote osteoclast differentiation in low RANKL conditions, while in high RANKL conditions, they may lead to suppression of differentiation (Combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R differentially regulates varying levels of RANKL). IL-6 is primarily produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and bone marrow stromal cells (IL-6 in inflammation).

Tumor Necrosis Factor -alpha (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known as a homotrimeric protein, which is able to bind to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1) and tumor necrosis factor-2 (TNF-R2)49,50.  TNF-α induces a diversity of signaling events that lead to cell necrosis, apoptosis, and other roles in immunity involving cancer resistance and development49. This pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a central role in inflammation and can potentiate the effects of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in both the innate and adaptive immune system50.  TNF-α also plays a role in a variety of functions, such as enhancing the expression of chemokines and facilitating neutrophil recruitment to inflamed sites50.  It can even trigger the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that can induce fever and release of acute inflammation phase proteins50. In bone resorption, TNF-α can directly act on osteoclast precursors to induce differentiation of mature osteoclasts and their activation28,42. It can also indirectly promote osteoclast formation by upregulating the production of M-CSF and RANKL on mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts, and synovial fibroblasts42. TNF-α is able to synergize with RANKL to enhance osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and induce osteoclast formation directly in cells 29. Additionally, this pro-inflammatory cytokine can suppress osteoblast differentiation, hindering bone formation. With the imbalance, increased resorption and decreased bone formation will lead to tragic bone loss. TNF-α is produced by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the innate immune system, neutrophils, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, etc. 

Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that is also commonly known as CXCL8, belonging to the CXC chemokine family that primarily acts on CXCR1 and CXCR2, which regulate the migration of leukocytes51,52.  IL-8 was initially recognized as a neutrophil-specific chemoattractant, playing a crucial role in recruiting and activating neutrophils so sites of infection, inflammation, and injury51–53. Once neutrophils are signaled to arrive, IL-8 stimulates their activation to perform their roles of degranulation, phagocytosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Although IL-8 has been known to be a neutrophil chemoattractant, it has been discovered to help with other roles in the immune system. This pro-inflammatory cytokine is a significant mediator for acute and chronic inflammation that contributes to tissue injury, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. In cancer, IL-8 even enhances tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. In bone resorption, IL-8 influences osteoclastogenesis, the process of osteoclast formation and activation.  IL-8 can directly stimulate the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts54. It enhances osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis by increasing IL-6 production by osteoblasts55. Macrophages and developing osteoblasts also secrete IL-8 in response to the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). IL-8 can also indirectly influence osteoclastogenesis through the stimulation of osteoblastic cells to produce RANKL. Cells that secrete this pro-inflammatory cytokine include a wide range of leukocytes, such as monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, etc., stromal cells like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and other cells. 

### K.	Neutrophils 

Neutrophils are an abundant white blood cell that act as one of the first responders in the presence of an infection and migrate to the inflammation site 56. Neutrophils are released from the bone marrow and circulate in the human bloodstream, where they represent 50-70% of white blood cells (Figure 16)57. These cells begin as a common myeloid progenitor and undergo many maturation stages until they finally become a mature polymorphonuclear neutrophil58. This process is controlled by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is involved in the production of neutrophils during the inflammatory responses. It helps maintain neutrophil survival and migration, often in conjunction with macrophages15,58. The primary functions of neutrophils include phagocytosis, which is the engulfing of pathogens, degranulation, which is the release of the cell’s contents, such as the granules (membrane-bound organelles), and NETosis, the formation of weblike DNA traps (Figure 17)59,60. In bone resorption, neutrophils play a significant role through RANKL expression and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. With RANKL expression, neutrophils will also stimulate osteoclast precursors to differentiate into osteoclasts and activate them for bone destruction. While neutrophils also release the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, these cytokines help promote osteoclastogenesis by upregulating the expression of RANKL in other cells, such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts30. These pro-inflammatory cytokines can also directly activate osteoclasts to resorb the bone tissue. Although there is still limited information on the induction of neutrophils in osteoclastogenesis, studies have shown that neutrophils express low levels of RANKL, which is needed to activate RANK on osteoclast precursors61. This is the reason the other pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) play a role altogether in stimulation. Neutrophils only survive about 6-24 hours in inflamed tissues, whereas osteoclast differentiation can take several days.

### L. Neutrophils in Bone Homeostasis and Inflammatory Bone Remodeling 

Although neutrophils are classically characterized as short-lived innate immune cells involved in pathogen clearance, increasing evidence indicated that they also play an active role in bone physiology and remodeling. Neutrophils are abundant within the bone marrow microenvironment, where they interact with hematopoietic stem cells, osteoblasts, osteoclast precursors, and stromal cells. These interactions position neutrophils as regulators of both immune and skeletal homeostasis rather than passive bystanders within bone tissue.62 In steady-state conditions, neutrophils contribute to maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors that influence osteoblast and osteoclast activity. 

Beyond homeostasis, neutrophils have been implicated in bone remodeling during injury and repair. During fracture healing, neutrophils are among the first cells recruited to the injury site, where they initiate the inflammatory phase necessary for proper bone regeneration63. Through the release of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1ß, and IL-6, neutrophils modulate the recruitment and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitors, indirectly influencing osteoblast activity and new bone formation. While transient neutrophil activity is beneficial for bone repair, prolonged or dysregulated neutrophil activation has been associated with impaired healing and excessive bone loss.

Neutrophils also contribute to pathological bone resorption under chronic inflammatory conditions. Several studies have demonstrated that activated neutrophils can potentially promote osteoclastogenesis through both indirect and direct mechanisms64. Indirectly, neutrophil-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines enhance RANKL expression on osteoblasts and fibroblasts, amplifying osteoclast differentiation30,31. More recently, neutrophils themselves have been shown to express membrane-bound RANKL under inflammatory conditions, enabling direct stimulation of RANK-expressing osteoclast precursors through cell-cell contact. Although neutrophil-derived RANKL is generally expressed at lower levels than the rest of osteoblasts or stromal cells, its localized and membrane-bound nature may confer potent osteoclastogenic signaling within inflamed microenvironments. Collectively, these findings highlight neutrophils as active contributors to inflammatory bone loss and provide a mechanistic basis for investigating their role in periprosthetic osteolysis and implant-associated bone resorption.

### M. Relationship between Neutrophils and Osteoclasts

Neutrophils are among the first immune cells recruited to sites of inflammation and are highly abundant in periprosthetic tissues following implant placement and wear debris generation. Traditionally, regarded as short-lived innate immune cells responsible for pathogen clearance, neutrophils are now recognized as active regulators of inflammatory signaling and tissue remodeling. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils contribute to pathological bone resorption by modulating osteoclast differentiation and activity. 

Neutrophils influence osteoclastogenesis primarily through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß), and interleukin (IL-6), all of which are known to enhance osteoclast precursor differentiation and survival. These cytokines can act synergistically with RANK-RANKL signaling to amplify osteoclast activation, particularly within chronic inflammatory environments such as those surrounding prosthetic implants. In addition to soluble mediators, neutrophils can interact directly with osteoclast precursors, further promoting osteoclastogenesis. 

Several studies have demonstrated that activated neutrophils are capable of expressing receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa ß ligand (RANKL) on their cell surface under inflammatory conditions. Although neutrophil-derived RANKL is typically expressed at lower levels compared to osteoblasts or stromal cells, its membrane-bound localization enables direct cell-cell contact with RANK-expressing osteoclast precursors. This form of RANKL signaling is particularly potent and may contribute to localized osteoclast activation in the periprosthetic microenvironment. As a result, neutrophils may function as accessory osteoclastogenic cells that enhance bone resorption during sustained inflammation. 

Collectively, these findings highlight a previously underappreciated role for neutrophils in inflammatory bone loss and suggest that neutrophil-mediated regulation of osteoclast activity may contribute to the progression of osteolytic loosening. Understanding the interactions between neutrophils and osteoclasts is therefore essential for elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying implant failure and for identifying strategies to mitigate pathological bone resorption. 

### N.	Selection of Metallic Alloys for the Study of Inflammatory Osteolysis

Metallic alloys are widely used in orthopedic implants due to their favorable mechanical strength, durability, and load-bearing capacity. However, the long-term performance of these materials is compromised by the generation of wear debris, which can accumulate in periprosthetic tissues and trigger chronic inflammatory responses. The chemical composition of implant materials plays a critical role in determining the biological reactivity of wear particles and their interactions with immune cells, thereby influencing the progression of osteolysis and implant loosening64. 

In this study, three metallic alloys were selected to evaluate how variations in alloy composition affect neutrophil activation and osteoclastogenic signaling. A conventional titanium alloy was used as a baseline material, while two boron-containing alloys were included to investigate the effects of boron incorporation on inflammatory responses.65 These alloys were chosen to represent clinically relevant materials with distinct compositional and biological characteristics, allowing for comparative analysis of immune-material interactions. 

Boron is a trace element known to influence both material properties and biological processes66. From a materials perspective, boron is commonly added in small quantities to titanium alloys to improve hardness, wear resistance, and microstructural stability, all of which are desirable characteristics for orthopedic implants. Biologically, evidence for boron’s beneficial role in bone metabolism remains limited in current literature. While titanium-boron alloys have shown comparable cytocompatibility to conventional titanium in some assays, the data reveal a more complex inflammatory profile: boron-modified alloys consistently amplified inflammatory cytokine release–particularly IL-6 and IL-8– without conferring uniform immunosuppressive benefits. However, evidence that boron universally enhances biocompatibility remains limited, and immune responses to boron-containing alloys appear to be dependent on alloy composition, boron concentration, and cell type examined. The incorporation of boron into implant alloys may therefore alter the characteristics of wear debris and its interaction with immune cells, potentially influencing inflammatory signaling rather than uniformly suppressing it65.

 By comparing a conventional alloy with boron-modified alloys, this study aims to assess whether targeted changes in implant composition affect neutrophil behavior and downstream osteoclastogenic pathways. Understanding how alloy chemistry modulates immune-driven bone resorption may inform the development of implant materials with improved biological performance and a reduced risk of osteolytic loosening. 
 
## Chapter 2: Thesis Objective 

The number of patients receiving prosthetic joint implants in the United States continues to rise as the population ages and younger individuals undergo arthroplasty procedures earlier in life. With total hip and knee arthroplasties (THA and TKA) projected to exceed several million procedures annually in the coming decades, there is an urgent need to improve the longevity and biological performance of implant materials. A major factor limiting implant lifespan is the development of aseptic osteolytic loosening, a biological factor limiting implant lifespan is the development of aseptic loosening, a biological complication driven by chronic inflammation at the bone-implant surface. As metal implants undergo corrosion and mechanical wear, particulate debris accumulates in the periprosthetic environment, where it is detected by immune cells. The resulting inflammatory cascade leads to the release of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, and IL-8, which stimulate osteoclast differentiation through the RANK-RANKL signaling pathway and ultimately promote bone resorption. Over time, this progressive bone loss weakens the structural support of the prosthetic device and frequently requires costly and invasive revision surgery. 

Although macrophages and fibroblasts are well-established mediators of wear debris-induced inflammation, the role of neutrophils in this process remains poorly understood. Neutrophils are among the earliest responders to foreign materials and have the capacity to phagocytose debris, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that influence the behavior of other immune and bone-associated cells. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils may express low levels of RANKL, providing a possible mechanism through which they could contribute directly or indirectly to osteoclastogenesis. However, little research has investigated how neutrophil-like cells respond specifically to modern prosthetic materials, including experimental titanium-boron alloys engineered to improve mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and long-term biocompatibility. 

The goal of this study is to characterize the biological responses of HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) to traditional and experimental titanium-based metals in order to evaluate their suitability as prosthetic implant materials. This work focuses on comparing standard Ti-6Al-4V, stainless steel, and novel titanium-boron alloys to determine how each material influences neutrophil activation. To accomplish this, differentiated NLCs were evaluated for three major indicators of immune activation: phagocytic uptake of foreign material (modeled by using fluorescent beads), inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF) following exposure to either metal particles or solid metal disks, and RANKL expression measured to determine whether these materials stimulate neutrophil driven osteoclastogenic signaling. Together, these assays provide an integrated assessment of how titanium-boron alloys influence neutrophil behavior compared to conventional prosthetic metals.

Our central hypothesis is that the experimental titanium-boron alloys will elicit an inflammatory response equal to or lower than that induced by traditional Ti-6Al-4V and stainless steel, thereby demonstrating improved biocompatibility. By identifying alloys that minimize neutrophil activation, this study aims to contribute to the development of prosthetic materials that reduce early inflammatory signaling, limit osteoclast activation, and ultimately prolong lifespan.  Understanding neutrophil responses to metal alloys provides a critical and previously unexplored dimension of implant biocompatibility, offering insight into how the earliest stages of the immune reaction may shape long-term outcomes in arthroplasty.

## Chapter 3: Materials and Methods 
### A. Cell Cultures

HL-60 cells are suspension cells isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient with promyelocytic leukemia. These promyeloblast cells are used as a model in immune response studies because of their ability to differentiate into different lineages of mature myeloid cells. This cell provides a versatile model for this project due to its ability to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells and osteoclasts. 

HL-60 cells were retrieved from the liquid nitrogen storage, where they have been cryopreserved in  10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 90% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to minimize cell death during the freezing process. Upon thawing, DMSO was diluted and neutralized using pre-warmed complete media to reduce the DMSO’s toxicity. The complete media consisted of 500mL of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM), supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Following washing, HL-60 cells were resuspended in complete media and seeded into a T-75 tissue culture flask at a density of 2.0 x 105 cells per mL (equivalent to 1mL of media per 2.0x105 cells). Cell culture was maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO2. The media was replenished 3 times per week or until color indicated nutrient depletion. Once the HL-60 cells began proliferating at an accelerating rate, more media was added to maintain a healthy cell density. 

### B.	HL-60 differentiation into Neutrophil-Like Cells (NLCs)

Cells were seeded in a T-75 tissue culture flask at a density of 2.0 x 105 cells per mL of complete media. To prepare for differentiation, all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was diluted to a 1:100 dilution from a 100µM stock to obtain a working solution of 1µM. Differentiation of HL-60 cells into neutrophil-like cells was induced by adding 1.25% DMSO and 1µM of ATRA to the final concentration. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 3-4 days at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. 

### C.	Cell surface receptors and flow cytometry

Differentiation of HL-60 cells was confirmed via surface antibody staining and detection by flow cytometry using a MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Differentiated cells at a density of 1.0 x 106 were harvested and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000RPM. The supernatant was removed, and cells were added along with one of the following two primary antibodies. In one of the microcentrifuge tubes containing differentiated cells, 1µL of the primary anti-CD11b antibody was added into the tube. CD11b (BIORAD, MCA-551) is used to stain to confirm neutrophil-like cell differentiation. A primary antibody, normal mouse IgG1, was used for the isotype control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC- 3877) in the second microcentrifuge tube; 5µL of the isotype was added to one of the samples. Once the primary antibodies are added to each sample, resuspended in PBS/ 2% FBS to obtain a final volume of 100µL. The cells are covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatant was decanted while the pellet was conserved. Cells were resuspended in 200µL of PBS/ 2% FBS to wash the cells and centrifuge again. The supernatant was decanted again, and in each of the samples, 2.5µL of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG- fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2010), along with PBS/ 2% FBS, was added to obtain a final volume of 100µL for each sample. Cells were covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes and the wash step was repeated. After the wash, cells were resuspended in 150µL of PBS/ 2% FBS and transferred into FACS tubes to be analyzed via the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). Data was analyzed and graphed using the program FlowJo. 

### D.	NLC Phagocytic Activity with fluorescent beads and Microscopy

A phagocytosis assay was performed after differentiation to confirm NLC activity.  A stock solution of Fluoresbrite Polychromatic 1µm beads (Polysciences Inc, PA, product number: 18660) was created with one drop of the beads along with 1mL of complete IMDM media. From this working stock solution, a 1:10 dilution was created with complete IMDM media. HL-60 differentiated NLCs were seeded in a 12-well culture plate at a density of 2.0x105 cells per well with a final volume of 900µL. In one well, 100µL from the working stock solution of the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads was added to create a 1:10 dilution in the well. In another well, 100µL of the 1:10 diluted Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads were added to create a 1:100 dilution into the well. All wells contained a total volume of 1000µL after adding the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads dilutions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours for phagocytosis to occur. Following incubation, the cells were transferred into another well using a cell strainer with a mesh of 1µm to filter out any excess fluorescent beads. The cell strainer was then placed upside down over a well to flush out the NLCs using complete IMDM media. One drop of Giemsa stain was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Cells were then immediately viewed and evaluated for phagocytic activity using a Nikon TE 300 fluorescent microscope and NIS- Element AR 3.2 software. 

### E.	NLC Phagocytic Activity with fluorescent beads using Flow Cytometry

A phagocytosis assay was performed after differentiation to confirm NLC activity.  A stock solution of Fluoresbrite Polychromatic 1µm beads (Polysciences Inc, PA, product number: 18660) was created with one drop of the beads along with 1mL of complete IMDM media. From this working stock solution, a 1:10 dilution was created with complete IMDM media. HL-60 differentiated NLCs were seeded in a 12-well culture plate at a density of 2 x 105  cells per well with a final volume of 900µL. In one well, 100µL from the working stock solution of the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads was added to create a 1:10 dilution in the well. In another well, 100µL of the 1:10 diluted Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads were added to create a 1:100 dilution in the well. All wells contained a total volume of 1000µL after adding the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads dilutions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours for phagocytosis to occur. Following incubation, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. Microcentrifuge tubes were spun down at centrifuged at 1000RPM for 5 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted, and pellet was conserved to stain with CD11b antibody. In all the microcentrifuge tubes containing differentiated cells along with the fluorescent beads, 1µL of the primary anti-CD11b antibody (BIORAD, MCA-551) was added into the tube. Once the primary antibodies are added to each sample, resuspended in PBS/ 2% FBS to obtain a final volume of 100µL. The cells are covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatant was decanted while the pellet was conserved. Cells were resuspended in 200µL of PBS/ 2% FBS to wash the cells and centrifuge again. The supernatant was decanted again, and in each of the samples, 2.5µL of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG- fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2010), along with PBS/ 2% FBS, was added to obtain a final volume of 100µL for each sample. Cells were covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes and the wash step was repeated. After the wash, cells were resuspended in 150µL of PBS/ 2% FBS and transferred into FACS tubes to be analyzed via the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). Data was analyzed and graphed using the program FlowJo. 

### F.	Metal particle samples for nano-particle debris assay

Metallic particle samples of Ti64 were used along with Ti64 samples containing different percentages of boron (0%, 0.5%, and 1%), kindly donated by Crucible Research (Pittsburgh, PA). All particle samples were passed through a mesh sieve approximately 75µM in size (Figure 18). Metal particles were placed in a glass vial where they were each weighed and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube containing 10mg of each metal. All microcentrifuge 

Following sterilization, in each microcentrifuge tube, 1mL of complete IMDM media was added. While pipetting up and down to mix properly, 100µL of the stock solution of metal was added into an additional microcentrifuge  tube along with 900µL of complete IMDM media to create solutions containing 1mg of metal particles per mL of media. 

Succeeding neutrophil-like cell differentiation, NLCs were counted and seeded in a 24 well plate with each well containing 1x106 NLCs and the 1mg of the metal particle solution. For a positive control, 1x106 cells were seeded in a well along with 500ng of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Invitrogen, catalog number:00-4976) and 5mM of ATP with a final volume of 1ml of complete IMDM media. Another well contained the 1x106 NLCs with only 500ng of LPS per 1ml of complete media and an additional well containing only 5mM of ATP with 1x106 NLCs in 1mL of complete IMDM media.  Each condition was tested in duplicates; NLCs were incubated with their respective conditions for 12 and 48 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Following incubations, the contents of each well were transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000RPM for 5 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant of each condition was collected and transferred into a cryogenic vial and placed in a -80 °C freezer for later use. The cell pellet is conserved and placed on ice for same day analysis of cell surface staining of RANKL.

### G.	Solid Metal Samples for cytokine secretion assay

One-half-inch diameter metal rods of Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) solid metal alloy disks containing different percentages of boron (0.1 and 1.09) were supplied by Dr. Vilupanur Ravi (Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA). Stainless steel (SS316L) was purchased from McMaster-Carr (Santa Fe Springs, CA). All metal rods were cut into 3mm thick, half-inch diameter disks via wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) by Southwest EDM (Glendora, CA). All metal surfaces were prepped for in vitro analysis by Silicone Carbide (SiC) grit paper to a grit size of 800-1200. Metal samples were then cleansed with soap, sonicated three times in distilled water and alcohol. Metals were autoclaved at 121 °C and 15psi for 15 minutes as previously performed for sterilizing the metal particles67. 

Once metal disks have been completely sterilized, they were placed into individual wells in a 12-well plate (Figure 19). Differentiated NLCs were seeded on top of each of the metal disks at a cell concentration of 1x106 cells per mL. Each condition was tested in duplicates and incubated for 12 and 48 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Following incubations, the contents of each well were transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000RPM for 5 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant of each condition was collected and transferred into a cryogenic vial and placed in a -80 °C freezer for later use. The cell pellet was placed on ice for cell surface staining for same-day analysis of RANKL. 

### H.	 Inflammatory Cytokine Secretion

Cytokine secretion in the presence of metal particles and metal disks was analyzed using the frozen supernatants that were previously collected. The secretion of cytokines was determined by using a Multiplex bead-based assay kit (LEGENDplex-Human Anti-Virus Response Panel V02) to identify the presence of TNF-α, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. The kit uses fluorescently encoded beads specific to an individual cytokine to determine the cytokine population within the sample. The beads can be purchased individually based on the target cytokine to create a bead cocktail. In this experiment, the target cytokines included: TNF-α, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. Essentially, the cytokine will bind to its targeted bead, and detection antibodies (PE) will be used that bind to the same cytokine, forming a sandwich complex to be analyzed via flow cytometry (Figure 20). 

To create a cocktail, the individual subpanel beads were vortexed at high speed for 1 minute before combining with one another and diluted with assay buffer to create a 1x dilution. During the entire assay procedure, all reagents were warmed to room temperature (20-25degrees C) .  in a 96 v-bottom well plate, 25µL of assay buffer was added into the 8 standard wells and sample wells. Next 25µL of the standards will be added into the standard wells. 25µL of the supernatant samples that were frozen at -80 degrees C in an earlier protocol were thawed and added into the sample wells to test TNF-α, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. Following that, the bead cocktail that has been previously prepared was vortexed for 30 seconds and 25µL of the beads was added into each well. Each well was mixed by pipetting; the total volume in each well should contain 75µL. The plate was then sealed using a plate sealer and covered with aluminum foil to protect from light. Plate was incubated on a plate shaker at 800rpm for 2 hours at room temperature. After this incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 1050rpm for 5 minutes using a swinging bucket rotor with a microplate adapter. Immediately after centrifugation, the supernatant was disposed of in a biohazard waste container by quickly inverting the plate in one continuous and forceful motion, keeping the pellet intact. The plate was then washed using 200µL of the 1x wash buffer provided in the kit into each well and incubated for one minute. Then completed the centrifugation process and supernatant disposal two more times. Once the washing has been completed, 25µL of the detection antibodies from the kit were added into each well. The plate was then sealed with a new plate sealer and covered with aluminum once again. The plate was placed on a plate shaker at 800rpm for one hour at room temperature. After incubation, without performing a wash step, 25µL of SA-PE was added into each well. The plate was sealed with a plate sealer and wrapped in aluminum while on a plate shaker at 800 rpm for 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, the wash steps were completed twice by centrifuging the plate at 1050rpm, discarding supernatant, and adding 200µL of 1x wash buffer. Finally, 150µL of the 1X wash buffer is added into each well while resuspending beads by pipetting. The samples are then kept on ice and read through the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) the same day. To further analyze all data, FCS files obtained from the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) were uploaded onto the BioLegend’s Data Analysis Software Suite for LEGENDplex. 

### I.	Osteoclast-Cell Like Differentiation 

Using the HL60- cell line, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate with a cell density of 1x106 before differentiating into osteoclasts. Cells were induced by 50 nM Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA; Catalog # 524400; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) and 10nM 1α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Vit D3; Catalog#H-089; Millipore Sigma, CA). Cells were allowed to incubate for 48 hours at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 

### J.	RANKL Expression Flow Cytometry

RANKL detection was confirmed using via surface antibody staining and detection by flow cytometry using a MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). Using the cell pellets that were previously collected and kept on ice, each microcentrifuge tube contained an NLCs cell density of 1x106 cells. From there, 2.5µL of RANKL (G-1)-FITC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-377079) was added to each sample. 97.5µL of PBS/2% FBS was added to each sample and resuspended by pipetting. Samples were covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatant was decanted while the pellet was conserved. Cells were resuspended in 200 µL of PBS/2 % FBS to wash the cells and then centrifuged again. The wash step was completed twice. Once the washing has been performed, 150 µL of PBS/2 % FBS was added to each microcentrifuge tube and resuspended by pipetting. Each sample was transferred into a flow cytometer tube and kept on ice until analyzed by the flow cytometer the same day.

### K.	Analysis of CD11b and RANKL Surface Staining Using FlowJo

Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo Software (v10, BD Biosciences). The gating strategy included sequentially gating on viable target cells using forward  and side scatter, selecting singlets to exclude aggregates, and identifying CD11b positive NLCs. Fluorescent bead uptake was analyzed in CD11b positive cells by comparing FITC (CD11b) and PE (fluorescent beads) channels. Isotype-stained controls were used to establish gating thresholds. Gates were set based on forward and side scatter to exclude debris and doublets, and fluorescence signals were compared to isotype controls. 

### L.	Analysis of Inflammatory Cytokine Secretion Using LEGENDplex Software

Flow cytometry data obtained from the cytokine secretion assay were analyzed using the LEGENDplex  Data Analysis Software Suite (BioLegend). Standard samples were first analyzed to generate a standard curve for each cytokine. Experimental sample data files were then uploaded, and cytokine concentrations were automatically calculated by the software based on the corresponding standard curves. 

## Chapter 4: Results 
### A.	Establishment of Activated Neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) from HL-60 Promyelocytic Cell line 

To test the effects of the titanium-boron metal alloys on NLCs, the HL-60 cell line serves as a model for neutrophil response. The HL-60 cell line is a promyelocytic cell that can be differentiated into various cell types, such as neutrophil-like cells (NLCs), osteoclast-like cells, macrophage-like cells, etc. HL-60 cells are a good model used to study neutrophil behaviors and the differentiation process57. To achieve differentiation into NLCs, HL-60 cells were treated with 1.25% DMSO and 1µM of ATRA to the final concentration as previously described in the HL-60 differentiation into Neutrophil-Like Cells (NLCs) section. After 72 hours, cells began to exhibit morphological changes such as smaller size and irregular shape. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells are suspension cells and exhibit a rounder morphology (Figure ).

To confirm the differentiation of HL-60 cells into NLCs, flow cytometry analysis of CD11b was performed. CD11b was chosen due to it being a common neutrophil cell surface marker57. (Figure 21) shows the expression of CD11b. All experiments show CD11b expression is increased on HL-60 cells by more than 50% after a 72-hour treatment with 1.25% DMSO and 1µM of ATRA. In all trials, the HL-60 treated cells were stained with an IgG1 antibody to act as an isotype control shown in blue. The isotype is used to display any background binding that occurs when there is no specific target.  Undifferentiated HL-60 cells were stained with CD11b antibody to act as a negative control, shown in orange. HL-60 cells treated with ATRA and DMSO were stained with CD11b antibody and shown in red on the graphs (Figure 21).

### B.	Confirmation of the Phagocytic capability of NLCs from HL-60 cells Using Microscopy

To determine the capability of phagocytosis on NLCs, a phagocytosis assay was performed using 1µm fluorescent polychromatic beads. This assay was used to confirm whether differentiated HL-60 cells were capable of phagocytosing fluorescent beads, mimicking an in vivo periprosthetic environment. As seen in (Figure 22) ,it is difficult to determine whether the cells are phagocytosing the fluorescent beads. Ideally, successful phagocytosis would be indicated by the clear localization of bright fluorescent beads within the differentiated NLC. However, under the microscope, the beads were difficult to distinguish from extracellular debris, making it challenging to confirm internalization. Therefore, microscopy results were inconclusive, and an alternative approach was employed to verify phagocytic activity. 

### C.	Confirmation of the Phagocytic Capability of NLCs from HL-60 cells Using Flow Cytometry

Since visualization by microscopy was inconclusive and did not allow a reliable distinction between internalized and extracellular beads, flow cytometry was used as an alternative approach to confirm the phagocytic activity of neutrophil-like cells (NLCs). Flow cytometry enables single-cell analysis and separates true bead uptake from surface-bound or ambient fluorescence, providing a more definitive assessment of phagocytosis. 

Differentiated NLCs were incubated with fluorescent 1µm beads for 24 hours and analyzed using a multistep gating strategy (Figures 23-26). First, the main viable cell population was identified using forward and side scatter (FSC-A vs SSC-A). Singlet selection (FSC-A vs FSC-H) to remove doublets and aggregates. Within the singlet population, CD11 b-positive cells were gated to isolate differentiated NLCs. Bead uptake was then evaluated by comparing FITC (CD11b) to PE (fluorescent beads). 

Isotype controls established baseline fluorescence and quadrant boundaries (Figure 23). CD11b positive controls (Figure 24) established a baseline for positive NLC differentiation.  In bead-treated samples, a clear CD11b Positive/ PE population emerged in the upper-right quadrant, representing NLCs that had internalized fluorescent beads. For the 1:10 dilution bead dilution, 88.5% of DC11b positive events were bead positive (Figure 25), indicating robust phagocytic activity. The 1:100 bead dilution also demonstrated a measurable bead-positive NLC population, confirming that uptake occurred even under lower particle exposure (Figure 26).

Together, these results verify that HL-60-derived NLCs retain functional phagocytic capability. Flow cytometry provided a definite assessment of bead internalization and established that the differentiated NLC population is competent to respond to particulate material- an essential prerequisite for subsequent cytokine secretion and RANKL expression analyses.

**Figure 1. HL-60 Differentiation after 3 days and 24 hour incubation with fluorescent beads post differentiation flow cytometry analysis.** The HL-60 cell line was differentiated into neutrophil-like cells using 1.25% DMSO and 1µM all-trans retinoic acid for 3 days. CD11Bb expression was analyzed in NLCs (A), NLCs with a 1:10 dilution of fluorescent beads for 24 hours (B), and NLCs with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescent beads for 24 hours.
