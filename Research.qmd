### INVESTIGATING EFFECTS OF NEUTROPHIL-LIKE CELLS (NLCs) BY NEW DEVELOPING METALS

**Department of Biological Sciences|California State Polytechnic University, Pomona**

## Abstract

The demand for prosthetics has gradually increased with the need for implants and the advancements in technology, making them more accessible to the growing population in the United States. Prosthetic recipients have become increasingly younger over time, resulting in a longer duration of implant use among this demographic. The extended implant duration within the physiological environment in the body can result in corrosion of the metal alloy. Metal debris resulting from the corrosion can induce an inflammatory response that can lead to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption around the implant. Bone resorption is the process of bone tissue dissolving through the action of specialized bone remodeling cells called osteoclasts. Monocytes and macrophages are precursors for osteoclast cells. One of the key signals in osteoclast formation is the activation of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa  (RANK) on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells, by RANK ligand (RANKL) on other cells, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. This ligand plays a crucial role by binding to the RANK receptors found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages, promoting their differentiation into osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts will attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid that degrades the bone. When this phenomenon occurs on the periphery, it causes osteolytic loosening. Different cell types are involved in the activation of bone resorption, including osteoclasts, macrophages, and fibroblasts, but it is not entirely known how neutrophils play a role in this process. Neutrophils are one of the first responders of the immune system in the presence of an antigen. They secrete many of the same cytokines as macrophages and fibroblasts that aid in osteoclast activation. It is unknown whether neutrophils detect metal debris resulting from implant corrosion or whether they are induced into an inflammatory response. This study seeks to provide more knowledge on neutrophil function in the presence of new metal alloys that could potentially be used for prosthetic implants. HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) were exposed to titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V), and novel titanium-boron alloys. Upon exposure, phagocytosis activity was analyzed along with inflammatory cytokine secretion using a cytometric bead array, and expression of NLC RANKL by flow cytometry. This is a comparative analysis of a series of metal alloys to determine which of them activates neutrophils the least, potentially making for a more biocompatible metal.


## Chapter 1: Introduction
### A. Prosthesis 

A prosthesis is an artificial device used to replace a missing or no longer functional body part (Figure 1). Reasons why many people obtain a prosthesis are due to amputations, age, injuries, and diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Prostheses nowadays can be made from a variety of metal alloys that each have benefits and disadvantages. 


### B. History of Prosthesis

Prostheses have been used for a large portion of history. It is unknown when the first prosthetic was created, but the oldest known prosthesis that has been identified is from ancient Egypt. One toe was made from papier-mache but would not bend, while another toe was created using wood and leather (Figure 2).  It was believed that prosthetics were created for cosmetic purposes rather than functionality. In Italy, at approximately 300 B.C., a prosthetic leg was made from bronze, hollowed wood, and leather straps. During the 16th century, the first functional prosthetic was created for soldiers who were coming off the battlefield1. During the American Civil War in 1860, the high number of amputees from the war caused a spike in prosthetic patents to quadruple. Figure 3 displays an artificial leg used by soldiers during the American Civil War. Throughout the 15th and 19th centuries, France and Switzerland began making prosthetics that were more functional by using cables, gears, and springs. Later in the 1900s, manufacturers were producing more functional prosthetics with more artificial materials like plastic, aluminum, titanium, and silicone to make the products lightweight and durable. 

### C.	Metals Used in Prosthesis  

As technology has advanced through the ages, more alterations have been made for patients that aid in users’ needs, such as pain reduction, mobility, and independence2.  Availability, cost, mechanical properties, and longevity must be part of the criteria for a successful prosthetic implant. Today, implant prosthetics are being made using materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and cobalt chrome 3. All metals used present a unique outcome due to the corrosion properties of the prosthetic after being implanted into a warm, wet, and salty environment, compounded by the natural movement of the body. Corrosion of such metal alloys may result in further complications for the user. These may include an inflammatory response that causes bone erosion, prosthetic failure, and the user receiving an entirely new prosthetic implant. Certain standards are required to establish a biocompatible metal. When metals are implanted into the patient, their positive charge is attracted to the negative charge of chloride ions in the human body. The chloride ions will pull titanium or iron or any positively charged metal out of the implant, leading to the accumulation of wear debris in the body. The free metal ions can also create harmful effects in surrounding tissues, including DNA damage. Moreover, high concentrations of metal ions have been shown to induce cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, etc., while minimal levels of metal concentration can initiate cytokine release. 

Titanium (Ti) is widely utilized for its exceptional biocompatibility, which significantly minimizes the risks of adverse reactions post-implantation surgery3. Upon exposure to physiological conditions, titanium forms a stable oxide layer on its surface, contributing to the enhancement of biocompatibility and promoting integration with surrounding tissues 4. The metal also exhibits favorable mechanical properties such as high strength and stiffness, making it suitable for load-bearing biomedical applications. The oxidation process is a key factor in its success as a biomaterial. However, titanium alone is relatively softer compared to titanium alloys.  Titanium alloys, such as 90% Titanium- 6% Aluminum- 4% Vanadium (Ti6Al4V) are commonly used for prosthetic implants (Figure 4). For this alloy, once the superoxide layer is broken, the metal ions are attracted to the Cl ions, and the Ti ions escape through the fracture and into the body. The Ti ions bind to oxygen, creating TiO2 debris, which causes an immune response.(Figure 5). Newer titanium alloys may be a better option, analyzing them for more strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility overall. 

Stainless steel is a metal alloy composed of chromium, nickel, and small amounts of  molybdenum 5 6. This alloy possesses a high resistance to corrosion 7 and is commonly used in surgical implants8,9 (Figure 6). It has low strength and ductility but can be very expensive to make.

 Cobalt Chrome is a very toxic metal alloy, but is also commonly used in medical implants due to its low chemical inertness and high corrosion resistance (Figure 7)10. The degradation through wear corrosion releases ions that can result in elevated levels of cobalt chrome in the body. Cobalt is highly toxic when concentrated at 7-10µg/L 3 or above.  The wear can become toxic, creating an immune response and leading to osteolytic loosening. It affects the immune system, is a carcinogen, induces cardiotoxicity, and causes mutagenesis.
 
### D. Demand for Prosthetics 

Prosthetic implants are steadily increasing in demand as the population ages and people’s bodies require structural reinforcement or replacements. The increasing demand is due to traumatic and non-traumatic causes of limb loss, and complications with current prosthetic implants. Current estimates indicate that 1.9 million individuals in the United States live with limb loss. This number is expected to double to 3.6 million people by 2050 11. Out of the growing patient population, only 15% of individuals with amputations currently have access to prosthetic devices 12, highlighting a disparity in healthcare availability for individuals with amputations. 

The underlying causes of limb loss are diverse, but can be categorized as trauma, cancer, infections, and vascular diseases 13,14. Among the complications associated with limb loss, bone resorption is one of the biological challenges that limits the longevity of prosthetic implants. Patients who receive prosthetic joint implants frequently require revision surgeries, replacement of the prosthetic, when bone resorption weakens the implant’s support. Current statistics show that over 10% of the patients who acquire total joint replacements require revision surgeries due to implant failures caused by osteolytic loosening15. These statistics demonstrate the downsides of metals that induce immune stimulation, which leads to bone degradation and shortened prosthetic implant longevity for patients.  

### E.	Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
An arthroplasty is a surgical procedure performed to restore the joint using a prosthetic implant (Figure 8). The procedure is intended to restore the function of the joint by improving mobility, reducing pain, and enhancing quality of life for patients. Among all prosthetic implant surgeries, total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are the most common prosthetic implants required by patients. Patients who undergo the procedure experience a relief from joint pain and functional improvement as long as the implant does not corrode. Weight-bearing implants such as these typically last approximately 15 years. 
In a total hip arthroplasty (THA), the damaged or diseased portion of the hip joint is replaced with artificial components. It is predicted that by the year 2030, there will be over 635,000 procedures performed annually in the United States16. Similarly, a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure where the damaged part of the knee joint is replaced with artificial implants. By the year 2030, more than 1.26 million TKA procedures will be conducted annually in the United States16,17. Recent Medicare projections predict that by 2040, THAs are expected to exceed 719,000 annually, while TKAs over 1.22 million17. By the year 2060,  it is expected that 2 million THAs and 3 million TKA procedures will be performed annually17.

Although primary arthroplasty procedures are successful, there are still complications that remain a challenge. Some of the most common complications following THA or TKA include biofilm formation on the metal, aseptic loosening, dislocation of the implant, infection, osteolysis from wear debris, sciatic nerve injuries, and insufficient bone bonding between bone and prosthesis 5. These complications often require revision surgeries, carrying a higher risk, higher cost, more physical therapy, and possibly associated with less favorable outcomes compared to the primary implant. Medicare projections show that the number of revision procedures is lower in number than primary procedures, with their rates still being substantial. It is expected that by the year 2040, about 43,5000 cases of THA revision surgeries will occur annually, and TKA revision surgeries will exceed nearly 115,000 cases per year 16. Correspondingly, by the year 2060, it is expected to nearly reach 62,000 cases of THA revision surgeries annually, while about 287,000 cases of THA revision surgeries would occur per year (Figure 9)16. 

These projections demonstrate the increasing demand for primary arthroplasties due to an aging population and the burden of added revision arthroplasties because of implant failure. This indicates a critical reason to find a durable biocompatible material that will prevent prosthetic failure, reduce the risk of revision surgeries, and enhance implant longevity.

### F.	Cost of Prosthetic Implants

The cost of prosthetic implants can be a burden to most patients, especially those who have no access to health care. Studies show that physical hip implants may range between $2,392 - $12,65118 while physical knee implants cost between $1,797- $12,093 18. Total joint arthroplasties are one of the largest expenditures in health care during the year with 1.5 million cases happening in the United States 18. 

The expenditure for the total arthroplasty procedures is actively rising throughout the years.  Statistics show that the cost for a primary TKA or THA with no complications is approximately $39,927- $195,264 19. However, when revision surgeries occur, the costs increase significantly, ranging from $58,967- $247,715, not including any complications that may occur during the procedure 19. One of the main challenges with the cost is the lack of transparency between physicians who did not have the accurate knowledge of the prices from different implant options. Many orthopedic providers believed that the more expensive implants had higher clinical value than the less expensive options. The lack of knowledge and awareness may contribute to the heightened healthcare spending. With the cost of these procedures, many low-income or uninsured individuals are avoiding the surgery, which leads them to more pain and less mobility. 

### G.	Complications with Prosthetic Implants

Complications that may arise with the use of prosthetic implants include both mechanical failures and biological responses, often resulting in implant failure requiring revision surgery. This occurs when the first implant stops working properly, and an additional surgery is required to replace the failing implant and insert a new one. Revision surgeries are common with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties, where metal debris can lead to implant failure, pseudotumor,  and soft tissue necrosis20. Inflammatory responses also occur in the presence of implants, where macrophages, fibroblasts, and neutrophils appear at the site of infection to fight off foreign invaders. This reaction contributes to osteolytic loosening, one of the primary biological causes of implant failure21. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is reported in roughly 0.5-2% of primary hip and knee arthroplasties, with incidence rising 4-5% after revision procedures and reaching as high as 20% among revision indications22,23. Early stage infections are most common within the first two years, where reported rates range from 0.8-2.1% for primary hip arthroplasty24. The infection rates underscore the clinical burden of PJI and its contribution to the need for revision surgery. 

Mechanical complications present a challenge among prosthetic implants. Corrosion can occur at implant sites where repetitive movement may cause the prosthetic to rub against the bone, releasing metal debris particles that spread into surrounding tissues20. Colonization of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis may also occur as a complication that can lead to infection and in some cases, revision surgery (Figure 10)25. 

With new advancements, the amount of wear debris production in the body has reduced and has increased overall implant longevity. Nevertheless, complication rates remain higher in revision arthroplasties compared to primary procedures, especially in TKA, where vascular and infection-related risks are elevated26.  

### H.	Osteolytic loosening 

Osteolysis is the process of bone loss resulting from an immune response that induces osteoclast activity, leading to bone resorption. This reaction occurs when the prosthetic implant creates wear debris, and the resulting metal particles accumulate in the tissue. Osteolytic loosening, also known as aseptic loosening, occurs as an outcome of osteolysis where the implant interfaces with the bone. When osteoclasts break down bone tissue around the prosthetic implant, that bone resorption weakens the bone-implant interface progressively over time (Figure 11). Osteolytic loosening is mainly driven by chronic bone resorption, a biological response to long-term exposure to the wear particles from the implant. It is the most common cause of implant failure, leading to increased revision surgeries27.

During osteolysis, osteoclasts degrade bone tissue and release the minerals from the bone, and deposit them into the patient’s body27,28. Osteoblasts, the counterparts to osteoclasts, will then attempt to reconstruct the worn-away bone tissue. However, complications arise when the balance between bone resorption and formation is disrupted. The activation of osteoclasts is regulated through the RANK—RANKL signaling pathway (Figure 12)29. Osteoclast precursors (OCPs) originating from the monocyte lineage express the receptor RANK, which binds to RANKL expressed by osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cells27,30. RANKL exists in two biologically active forms: a membrane-bound form and a soluble form, which differ in both structure and function. Membrane-bound RANKL (mRANKL) is expressed on the cell surface as a type II transmembrane protein and requires direct cell-cell contact to activate RANK on osteoclast precursors. This form provides strong, localized, and sustained signaling that is considered the primary driver of osteoclast differentiation and activation. In contrast, soluble RANKL (sRANKL) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane-bound RANKL and lacks the transmembrane region. As a diffusible ligand, sRANKL can act at a distance and contribute to broader inflammatory signaling; however, it generally induces weaker and less sustained osteoclastogenic signaling compared to membrane-bound RANKL. The balance between these two forms of RANKL influences the magnitude and spatial regulation of osteoclast activation, particularly within the localized inflammatory microenvironment surrounding prosthetic implants.

While RANK-RANKL signaling is essential for osteoclastogenesis, additional co-stimulatory and independent pathways significantly modulate osteoclast activation, particularly in inflammatory contexts such as periprosthetic osteolysis. Macrophage - Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF), acting through its receptor, is required for osteoclast precursor survival and proliferation but cannot alone induce terminal differentiation31. Immunoreceptor signaling through ITAM-containing adaptors (DAP12, FcRy) provides necessary co-stimulatory signals that activate calcium-dependent NFATc1, the master transcription factor for osteoclast formation31. Importantly, pro-inflammatory cytokines can bypass or amplify RANKL signaling: TNF-α directly induces osteoclast differentiation independently of RANKL and synergizes with permissive RANKL levels through shared NF-κB and JNK pathways. IL-1ß can mediate osteoclastogenesis in c-Fos-expressing precursors and contributes substantially to TNF-α-induced bone resorption in inflammatory arthritis. The chemokine IL-8 acts directly on osteoclast precursors through CXCR1 receptors to stimulate differentiation independently of RANKL. More recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been shown to induce rapid osteoclast formation via TLR4 activation, representing a RANKL-independent mechanism relevant in acute inflammatory responses31. These alternative pathways converge on common downstream effectors (NF-κB, c-Fos, NFATc1) and are particularly active in the cytokine-rich periprosthetic environment, where macrophage-derived TNF-α, fibroblast-derived RANKL, and neutrophil-released mediators collectively drive excessive osteoclast activation and bone loss. 

This interaction is enhanced by the parathyroid hormone, driving the differentiation of OCPs into mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts30,32. The mature osteoclasts will migrate to the bone surface to form a specialized sealed zone called the resorption lacuna. Then, osteoclast proton pumps secrete hydrogen ions, causing acidification that will begin the breakdown of bone mineral, hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)). Additionally, osteoclasts secrete proteolytic enzymes, such as cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAP), which degrade the collagen and organic components of bone 33. The resulting mineral ions and collagen fragments are then internalized by the osteoclast through endocytosis, transported through the cell, and released into the bloodstream as waste products. This process of demineralization and enzymatic digestion enables osteoclasts to resorb significant amounts of bone tissue. In a periprosthetic environment, when the mechanism is amplified by the persistent presence of wear debris, it leads to pathologic bone loss. Over time, the persistent activation of osteoclasts and bone resorption weakens the bone-implant interface, resulting in osteolytic loosening and implant failure. 

### I . Cells involved in bone resorption

Macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and lymphocytes are involved in bone resorption (Figure 14). Together, these diverse cell types create a dynamic micro-environment in which bone remodeling is tightly coordinated. The first interaction is primarily mediated through the stimulation of macrophages and their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines27. A pro-inflammatory cytokine is a type of small signaling protein released by immune cells in response to infection, injury, or inflammation. During bone resorption, diverse cells interact to coordinate bone remodeling, such as macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and neutrophils. Osteoblasts are specialized mesenchymal cells that form new bone tissue; they also produce RANKL and induce osteoclast formation. Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells derived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage. 

Macrophages are monocytes produced from the bone marrow that differentiate into mature macrophages and are recruited into tissues during homeostasis, inflammation, or infection (Figure 13) 34.  The primary functions of macrophages include the process of phagocytosis, immune regulation, and tissue-specific roles. Macrophages can engulf pathogens, apoptotic cells, and debris through phagocytosis 35. Additionally, these cells act as sentinel cells, which act as a first line of immune defense against pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). They release cytokines and other inflammatory mediators to signal other cells to the site of the threat. Macrophages also have tissue-specific roles in the bones, liver, adipose tissue, and brain34. These cells serve as osteoclast precursors (OCPs), which can differentiate into mature osteoclasts through a cytokine and a receptor-ligand interaction: Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL). Osteoblastic cells and stromal cells both produce M-CSF and RANKL, which bind to their receptors on OCPs. M-CSF binds to the c-fms receptor, while RANKL binds to its receptor RANK28,30,33. Through these pathways, mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts are formed28,30. The osteoclasts then attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsin K to degrade the bone28,29.

Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that are primarily responsible for maintaining and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Additionally, they provide structural support, regulate tissue repair, and act as signaling niche cells by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors36,37. Fibroblasts are also involved with fibrosis, the formation of fibrous connective tissue in response to injury, inflammation, or disease38. In response to injuries, fibroblasts can differentiate into myofibroblasts, which can actively remodel tissue38. In the bone resorption process, aggressive fibroblasts, known as prosthesis loosening fibroblasts (PLFs), have the ability to degrade the bone directly without the usage of osteoclasts, and use proteolytic enzymes like cathepsins to break the bone down36. Fibroblasts are also able to influence osteoclast-mediated bone resorption through two pathways: through RANKL production or pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Fibroblasts release RANKL, which binds to the RANK receptors on osteoclast precursors, such as monocytes/macrophages, to drive osteoclast differentiation39.  Their differentiation and activation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts is critical in initiating bone loss. Fibroblasts also have growth factors that play their own role in bone regeneration and osteogenesis. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), also known as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and FGF-β,  is able to enhance osteoblast proliferation, but excess FGF-2 may impair mineralization38.  FGF9 promotes angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessels stemming from existing ones, and osteoclast recruitment during bone healing. FGF18 stimulates osteoblast differentiation and supports bone repair40. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-⍺ all promote osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, intensifying the bone degradation27,41,42. 

### J. Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines 

The pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in bone resorption are IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF⍺. These four cytokines are all released by macrophages, fibroblasts, and neutrophils (Figure 15). 

IL-1 or interleukin-1 acts to increase vascular permeability, recruit leukocytes, induce fever, stimulate myeloid cell production, and regulate innate immunity. IL-1 is produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblast cell lineages, and neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli43,4445. IL-1 is able to stimulate osteoclast differentiation and activation by upregulating RANKL expression on osteoblasts and stromal cells42,44. It enhances osteoclast survival and bone resorbing activity.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine with diverse roles in inflammation, hematopoiesis,  immune responses, and host defense46,47. IL-6 can indirectly enhance osteoclast formation with the upregulation of RANKL on osteoblastic/stromal cells and fibroblasts31,47,48. By upregulating RANKL with the IL-6/sIL-6R, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, osteoclast precursors can promote osteoclast differentiation in low RANKL conditions, while in high RANKL conditions, they may lead to suppression of differentiation (Combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R differentially regulates varying levels of RANKL). IL-6 is primarily produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and bone marrow stromal cells (IL-6 in inflammation).

Tumor Necrosis Factor -alpha (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known as a homotrimeric protein, which is able to bind to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1) and tumor necrosis factor-2 (TNF-R2)49,50.  TNF-α induces a diversity of signaling events that lead to cell necrosis, apoptosis, and other roles in immunity involving cancer resistance and development49. This pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a central role in inflammation and can potentiate the effects of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in both the innate and adaptive immune system50.  TNF-α also plays a role in a variety of functions, such as enhancing the expression of chemokines and facilitating neutrophil recruitment to inflamed sites50.  It can even trigger the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that can induce fever and release of acute inflammation phase proteins50. In bone resorption, TNF-α can directly act on osteoclast precursors to induce differentiation of mature osteoclasts and their activation28,42. It can also indirectly promote osteoclast formation by upregulating the production of M-CSF and RANKL on mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts, and synovial fibroblasts42. TNF-α is able to synergize with RANKL to enhance osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and induce osteoclast formation directly in cells 29. Additionally, this pro-inflammatory cytokine can suppress osteoblast differentiation, hindering bone formation. With the imbalance, increased resorption and decreased bone formation will lead to tragic bone loss. TNF-α is produced by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the innate immune system, neutrophils, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, etc. 

Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that is also commonly known as CXCL8, belonging to the CXC chemokine family that primarily acts on CXCR1 and CXCR2, which regulate the migration of leukocytes51,52.  IL-8 was initially recognized as a neutrophil-specific chemoattractant, playing a crucial role in recruiting and activating neutrophils so sites of infection, inflammation, and injury51–53. Once neutrophils are signaled to arrive, IL-8 stimulates their activation to perform their roles of degranulation, phagocytosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Although IL-8 has been known to be a neutrophil chemoattractant, it has been discovered to help with other roles in the immune system. This pro-inflammatory cytokine is a significant mediator for acute and chronic inflammation that contributes to tissue injury, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. In cancer, IL-8 even enhances tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. In bone resorption, IL-8 influences osteoclastogenesis, the process of osteoclast formation and activation.  IL-8 can directly stimulate the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts54. It enhances osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis by increasing IL-6 production by osteoblasts55. Macrophages and developing osteoblasts also secrete IL-8 in response to the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). IL-8 can also indirectly influence osteoclastogenesis through the stimulation of osteoblastic cells to produce RANKL. Cells that secrete this pro-inflammatory cytokine include a wide range of leukocytes, such as monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, etc., stromal cells like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and other cells. 

### K.	Neutrophils 

Neutrophils are an abundant white blood cell that act as one of the first responders in the presence of an infection and migrate to the inflammation site 56. Neutrophils are released from the bone marrow and circulate in the human bloodstream, where they represent 50-70% of white blood cells (Figure 16)57. These cells begin as a common myeloid progenitor and undergo many maturation stages until they finally become a mature polymorphonuclear neutrophil58. This process is controlled by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is involved in the production of neutrophils during the inflammatory responses. It helps maintain neutrophil survival and migration, often in conjunction with macrophages15,58. The primary functions of neutrophils include phagocytosis, which is the engulfing of pathogens, degranulation, which is the release of the cell’s contents, such as the granules (membrane-bound organelles), and NETosis, the formation of weblike DNA traps (Figure 17)59,60. In bone resorption, neutrophils play a significant role through RANKL expression and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. With RANKL expression, neutrophils will also stimulate osteoclast precursors to differentiate into osteoclasts and activate them for bone destruction. While neutrophils also release the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, these cytokines help promote osteoclastogenesis by upregulating the expression of RANKL in other cells, such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts30. These pro-inflammatory cytokines can also directly activate osteoclasts to resorb the bone tissue. Although there is still limited information on the induction of neutrophils in osteoclastogenesis, studies have shown that neutrophils express low levels of RANKL, which is needed to activate RANK on osteoclast precursors61. This is the reason the other pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) play a role altogether in stimulation. Neutrophils only survive about 6-24 hours in inflamed tissues, whereas osteoclast differentiation can take several days.

### L. Neutrophils in Bone Homeostasis and Inflammatory Bone Remodeling 

Although neutrophils are classically characterized as short-lived innate immune cells involved in pathogen clearance, increasing evidence indicated that they also play an active role in bone physiology and remodeling. Neutrophils are abundant within the bone marrow microenvironment, where they interact with hematopoietic stem cells, osteoblasts, osteoclast precursors, and stromal cells. These interactions position neutrophils as regulators of both immune and skeletal homeostasis rather than passive bystanders within bone tissue.62 In steady-state conditions, neutrophils contribute to maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors that influence osteoblast and osteoclast activity. 

Beyond homeostasis, neutrophils have been implicated in bone remodeling during injury and repair. During fracture healing, neutrophils are among the first cells recruited to the injury site, where they initiate the inflammatory phase necessary for proper bone regeneration63. Through the release of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1ß, and IL-6, neutrophils modulate the recruitment and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitors, indirectly influencing osteoblast activity and new bone formation. While transient neutrophil activity is beneficial for bone repair, prolonged or dysregulated neutrophil activation has been associated with impaired healing and excessive bone loss.

Neutrophils also contribute to pathological bone resorption under chronic inflammatory conditions. Several studies have demonstrated that activated neutrophils can potentially promote osteoclastogenesis through both indirect and direct mechanisms64. Indirectly, neutrophil-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines enhance RANKL expression on osteoblasts and fibroblasts, amplifying osteoclast differentiation30,31. More recently, neutrophils themselves have been shown to express membrane-bound RANKL under inflammatory conditions, enabling direct stimulation of RANK-expressing osteoclast precursors through cell-cell contact. Although neutrophil-derived RANKL is generally expressed at lower levels than the rest of osteoblasts or stromal cells, its localized and membrane-bound nature may confer potent osteoclastogenic signaling within inflamed microenvironments. Collectively, these findings highlight neutrophils as active contributors to inflammatory bone loss and provide a mechanistic basis for investigating their role in periprosthetic osteolysis and implant-associated bone resorption.

### M. Relationship between Neutrophils and Osteoclasts

Neutrophils are among the first immune cells recruited to sites of inflammation and are highly abundant in periprosthetic tissues following implant placement and wear debris generation. Traditionally, regarded as short-lived innate immune cells responsible for pathogen clearance, neutrophils are now recognized as active regulators of inflammatory signaling and tissue remodeling. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils contribute to pathological bone resorption by modulating osteoclast differentiation and activity. 

Neutrophils influence osteoclastogenesis primarily through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß), and interleukin (IL-6), all of which are known to enhance osteoclast precursor differentiation and survival. These cytokines can act synergistically with RANK-RANKL signaling to amplify osteoclast activation, particularly within chronic inflammatory environments such as those surrounding prosthetic implants. In addition to soluble mediators, neutrophils can interact directly with osteoclast precursors, further promoting osteoclastogenesis. 

Several studies have demonstrated that activated neutrophils are capable of expressing receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa ß ligand (RANKL) on their cell surface under inflammatory conditions. Although neutrophil-derived RANKL is typically expressed at lower levels compared to osteoblasts or stromal cells, its membrane-bound localization enables direct cell-cell contact with RANK-expressing osteoclast precursors. This form of RANKL signaling is particularly potent and may contribute to localized osteoclast activation in the periprosthetic microenvironment. As a result, neutrophils may function as accessory osteoclastogenic cells that enhance bone resorption during sustained inflammation. 

Collectively, these findings highlight a previously underappreciated role for neutrophils in inflammatory bone loss and suggest that neutrophil-mediated regulation of osteoclast activity may contribute to the progression of osteolytic loosening. Understanding the interactions between neutrophils and osteoclasts is therefore essential for elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying implant failure and for identifying strategies to mitigate pathological bone resorption. 

### N.	Selection of Metallic Alloys for the Study of Inflammatory Osteolysis

Metallic alloys are widely used in orthopedic implants due to their favorable mechanical strength, durability, and load-bearing capacity. However, the long-term performance of these materials is compromised by the generation of wear debris, which can accumulate in periprosthetic tissues and trigger chronic inflammatory responses. The chemical composition of implant materials plays a critical role in determining the biological reactivity of wear particles and their interactions with immune cells, thereby influencing the progression of osteolysis and implant loosening64. 

In this study, three metallic alloys were selected to evaluate how variations in alloy composition affect neutrophil activation and osteoclastogenic signaling. A conventional titanium alloy was used as a baseline material, while two boron-containing alloys were included to investigate the effects of boron incorporation on inflammatory responses.65 These alloys were chosen to represent clinically relevant materials with distinct compositional and biological characteristics, allowing for comparative analysis of immune-material interactions. 

Boron is a trace element known to influence both material properties and biological processes66. From a materials perspective, boron is commonly added in small quantities to titanium alloys to improve hardness, wear resistance, and microstructural stability, all of which are desirable characteristics for orthopedic implants. Biologically, evidence for boron’s beneficial role in bone metabolism remains limited in current literature. While titanium-boron alloys have shown comparable cytocompatibility to conventional titanium in some assays, the data reveal a more complex inflammatory profile: boron-modified alloys consistently amplified inflammatory cytokine release–particularly IL-6 and IL-8– without conferring uniform immunosuppressive benefits. However, evidence that boron universally enhances biocompatibility remains limited, and immune responses to boron-containing alloys appear to be dependent on alloy composition, boron concentration, and cell type examined. The incorporation of boron into implant alloys may therefore alter the characteristics of wear debris and its interaction with immune cells, potentially influencing inflammatory signaling rather than uniformly suppressing it65.

 By comparing a conventional alloy with boron-modified alloys, this study aims to assess whether targeted changes in implant composition affect neutrophil behavior and downstream osteoclastogenic pathways. Understanding how alloy chemistry modulates immune-driven bone resorption may inform the development of implant materials with improved biological performance and a reduced risk of osteolytic loosening. 
 
## Chapter 2: Thesis Objective 

The number of patients receiving prosthetic joint implants in the United States continues to rise as the population ages and younger individuals undergo arthroplasty procedures earlier in life. With total hip and knee arthroplasties (THA and TKA) projected to exceed several million procedures annually in the coming decades, there is an urgent need to improve the longevity and biological performance of implant materials. A major factor limiting implant lifespan is the development of aseptic osteolytic loosening, a biological factor limiting implant lifespan is the development of aseptic loosening, a biological complication driven by chronic inflammation at the bone-implant surface. As metal implants undergo corrosion and mechanical wear, particulate debris accumulates in the periprosthetic environment, where it is detected by immune cells. The resulting inflammatory cascade leads to the release of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, and IL-8, which stimulate osteoclast differentiation through the RANK-RANKL signaling pathway and ultimately promote bone resorption. Over time, this progressive bone loss weakens the structural support of the prosthetic device and frequently requires costly and invasive revision surgery. 

Although macrophages and fibroblasts are well-established mediators of wear debris-induced inflammation, the role of neutrophils in this process remains poorly understood. Neutrophils are among the earliest responders to foreign materials and have the capacity to phagocytose debris, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that influence the behavior of other immune and bone-associated cells. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils may express low levels of RANKL, providing a possible mechanism through which they could contribute directly or indirectly to osteoclastogenesis. However, little research has investigated how neutrophil-like cells respond specifically to modern prosthetic materials, including experimental titanium-boron alloys engineered to improve mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and long-term biocompatibility. 

The goal of this study is to characterize the biological responses of HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) to traditional and experimental titanium-based metals in order to evaluate their suitability as prosthetic implant materials. This work focuses on comparing standard Ti-6Al-4V, stainless steel, and novel titanium-boron alloys to determine how each material influences neutrophil activation. To accomplish this, differentiated NLCs were evaluated for three major indicators of immune activation: phagocytic uptake of foreign material (modeled by using fluorescent beads), inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF) following exposure to either metal particles or solid metal disks, and RANKL expression measured to determine whether these materials stimulate neutrophil driven osteoclastogenic signaling. Together, these assays provide an integrated assessment of how titanium-boron alloys influence neutrophil behavior compared to conventional prosthetic metals.

Our central hypothesis is that the experimental titanium-boron alloys will elicit an inflammatory response equal to or lower than that induced by traditional Ti-6Al-4V and stainless steel, thereby demonstrating improved biocompatibility. By identifying alloys that minimize neutrophil activation, this study aims to contribute to the development of prosthetic materials that reduce early inflammatory signaling, limit osteoclast activation, and ultimately prolong lifespan.  Understanding neutrophil responses to metal alloys provides a critical and previously unexplored dimension of implant biocompatibility, offering insight into how the earliest stages of the immune reaction may shape long-term outcomes in arthroplasty.

## Chapter 3: Materials and Methods 
### A. Cell Cultures

HL-60 cells are suspension cells isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient with promyelocytic leukemia. These promyeloblast cells are used as a model in immune response studies because of their ability to differentiate into different lineages of mature myeloid cells. This cell provides a versatile model for this project due to its ability to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells and osteoclasts. 

HL-60 cells were retrieved from the liquid nitrogen storage, where they have been cryopreserved in  10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 90% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to minimize cell death during the freezing process. Upon thawing, DMSO was diluted and neutralized using pre-warmed complete media to reduce the DMSO’s toxicity. The complete media consisted of 500mL of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM), supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Following washing, HL-60 cells were resuspended in complete media and seeded into a T-75 tissue culture flask at a density of 2.0 x 105 cells per mL (equivalent to 1mL of media per 2.0x105 cells). Cell culture was maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO2. The media was replenished 3 times per week or until color indicated nutrient depletion. Once the HL-60 cells began proliferating at an accelerating rate, more media was added to maintain a healthy cell density. 

### B.	HL-60 differentiation into Neutrophil-Like Cells (NLCs)

Cells were seeded in a T-75 tissue culture flask at a density of 2.0 x 105 cells per mL of complete media. To prepare for differentiation, all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was diluted to a 1:100 dilution from a 100µM stock to obtain a working solution of 1µM. Differentiation of HL-60 cells into neutrophil-like cells was induced by adding 1.25% DMSO and 1µM of ATRA to the final concentration. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 3-4 days at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. 

### C.	Cell surface receptors and flow cytometry

Differentiation of HL-60 cells was confirmed via surface antibody staining and detection by flow cytometry using a MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Differentiated cells at a density of 1.0 x 106 were harvested and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000RPM. The supernatant was removed, and cells were added along with one of the following two primary antibodies. In one of the microcentrifuge tubes containing differentiated cells, 1µL of the primary anti-CD11b antibody was added into the tube. CD11b (BIORAD, MCA-551) is used to stain to confirm neutrophil-like cell differentiation. A primary antibody, normal mouse IgG1, was used for the isotype control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC- 3877) in the second microcentrifuge tube; 5µL of the isotype was added to one of the samples. Once the primary antibodies are added to each sample, resuspended in PBS/ 2% FBS to obtain a final volume of 100µL. The cells are covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatant was decanted while the pellet was conserved. Cells were resuspended in 200µL of PBS/ 2% FBS to wash the cells and centrifuge again. The supernatant was decanted again, and in each of the samples, 2.5µL of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG- fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2010), along with PBS/ 2% FBS, was added to obtain a final volume of 100µL for each sample. Cells were covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes and the wash step was repeated. After the wash, cells were resuspended in 150µL of PBS/ 2% FBS and transferred into FACS tubes to be analyzed via the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). Data was analyzed and graphed using the program FlowJo. 

### D.	NLC Phagocytic Activity with fluorescent beads and Microscopy

A phagocytosis assay was performed after differentiation to confirm NLC activity.  A stock solution of Fluoresbrite Polychromatic 1µm beads (Polysciences Inc, PA, product number: 18660) was created with one drop of the beads along with 1mL of complete IMDM media. From this working stock solution, a 1:10 dilution was created with complete IMDM media. HL-60 differentiated NLCs were seeded in a 12-well culture plate at a density of 2.0x105 cells per well with a final volume of 900µL. In one well, 100µL from the working stock solution of the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads was added to create a 1:10 dilution in the well. In another well, 100µL of the 1:10 diluted Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads were added to create a 1:100 dilution into the well. All wells contained a total volume of 1000µL after adding the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads dilutions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours for phagocytosis to occur. Following incubation, the cells were transferred into another well using a cell strainer with a mesh of 1µm to filter out any excess fluorescent beads. The cell strainer was then placed upside down over a well to flush out the NLCs using complete IMDM media. One drop of Giemsa stain was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Cells were then immediately viewed and evaluated for phagocytic activity using a Nikon TE 300 fluorescent microscope and NIS- Element AR 3.2 software. 

### E.	NLC Phagocytic Activity with fluorescent beads using Flow Cytometry

A phagocytosis assay was performed after differentiation to confirm NLC activity.  A stock solution of Fluoresbrite Polychromatic 1µm beads (Polysciences Inc, PA, product number: 18660) was created with one drop of the beads along with 1mL of complete IMDM media. From this working stock solution, a 1:10 dilution was created with complete IMDM media. HL-60 differentiated NLCs were seeded in a 12-well culture plate at a density of 2 x 105  cells per well with a final volume of 900µL. In one well, 100µL from the working stock solution of the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads was added to create a 1:10 dilution in the well. In another well, 100µL of the 1:10 diluted Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads were added to create a 1:100 dilution in the well. All wells contained a total volume of 1000µL after adding the Fluoresbrite Polychromatic beads dilutions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours for phagocytosis to occur. Following incubation, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. Microcentrifuge tubes were spun down at centrifuged at 1000RPM for 5 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted, and pellet was conserved to stain with CD11b antibody. In all the microcentrifuge tubes containing differentiated cells along with the fluorescent beads, 1µL of the primary anti-CD11b antibody (BIORAD, MCA-551) was added into the tube. Once the primary antibodies are added to each sample, resuspended in PBS/ 2% FBS to obtain a final volume of 100µL. The cells are covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatant was decanted while the pellet was conserved. Cells were resuspended in 200µL of PBS/ 2% FBS to wash the cells and centrifuge again. The supernatant was decanted again, and in each of the samples, 2.5µL of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG- fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2010), along with PBS/ 2% FBS, was added to obtain a final volume of 100µL for each sample. Cells were covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes and the wash step was repeated. After the wash, cells were resuspended in 150µL of PBS/ 2% FBS and transferred into FACS tubes to be analyzed via the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). Data was analyzed and graphed using the program FlowJo. 

### F.	Metal particle samples for nano-particle debris assay

Metallic particle samples of Ti64 were used along with Ti64 samples containing different percentages of boron (0%, 0.5%, and 1%), kindly donated by Crucible Research (Pittsburgh, PA). All particle samples were passed through a mesh sieve approximately 75µM in size (Figure 18). Metal particles were placed in a glass vial where they were each weighed and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube containing 10mg of each metal. All microcentrifuge 

Following sterilization, in each microcentrifuge tube, 1mL of complete IMDM media was added. While pipetting up and down to mix properly, 100µL of the stock solution of metal was added into an additional microcentrifuge  tube along with 900µL of complete IMDM media to create solutions containing 1mg of metal particles per mL of media. 

Succeeding neutrophil-like cell differentiation, NLCs were counted and seeded in a 24 well plate with each well containing 1x106 NLCs and the 1mg of the metal particle solution. For a positive control, 1x106 cells were seeded in a well along with 500ng of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Invitrogen, catalog number:00-4976) and 5mM of ATP with a final volume of 1ml of complete IMDM media. Another well contained the 1x106 NLCs with only 500ng of LPS per 1ml of complete media and an additional well containing only 5mM of ATP with 1x106 NLCs in 1mL of complete IMDM media.  Each condition was tested in duplicates; NLCs were incubated with their respective conditions for 12 and 48 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Following incubations, the contents of each well were transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000RPM for 5 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant of each condition was collected and transferred into a cryogenic vial and placed in a -80 °C freezer for later use. The cell pellet is conserved and placed on ice for same day analysis of cell surface staining of RANKL.

### G.	Solid Metal Samples for cytokine secretion assay

One-half-inch diameter metal rods of Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) solid metal alloy disks containing different percentages of boron (0.1 and 1.09) were supplied by Dr. Vilupanur Ravi (Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA). Stainless steel (SS316L) was purchased from McMaster-Carr (Santa Fe Springs, CA). All metal rods were cut into 3mm thick, half-inch diameter disks via wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) by Southwest EDM (Glendora, CA). All metal surfaces were prepped for in vitro analysis by Silicone Carbide (SiC) grit paper to a grit size of 800-1200. Metal samples were then cleansed with soap, sonicated three times in distilled water and alcohol. Metals were autoclaved at 121 °C and 15psi for 15 minutes as previously performed for sterilizing the metal particles67. 

Once metal disks have been completely sterilized, they were placed into individual wells in a 12-well plate (Figure 19). Differentiated NLCs were seeded on top of each of the metal disks at a cell concentration of 1x106 cells per mL. Each condition was tested in duplicates and incubated for 12 and 48 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Following incubations, the contents of each well were transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000RPM for 5 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant of each condition was collected and transferred into a cryogenic vial and placed in a -80 °C freezer for later use. The cell pellet was placed on ice for cell surface staining for same-day analysis of RANKL. 

### H.	 Inflammatory Cytokine Secretion

Cytokine secretion in the presence of metal particles and metal disks was analyzed using the frozen supernatants that were previously collected. The secretion of cytokines was determined by using a Multiplex bead-based assay kit (LEGENDplex-Human Anti-Virus Response Panel V02) to identify the presence of TNF-α, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. The kit uses fluorescently encoded beads specific to an individual cytokine to determine the cytokine population within the sample. The beads can be purchased individually based on the target cytokine to create a bead cocktail. In this experiment, the target cytokines included: TNF-α, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. Essentially, the cytokine will bind to its targeted bead, and detection antibodies (PE) will be used that bind to the same cytokine, forming a sandwich complex to be analyzed via flow cytometry (Figure 20). 

To create a cocktail, the individual subpanel beads were vortexed at high speed for 1 minute before combining with one another and diluted with assay buffer to create a 1x dilution. During the entire assay procedure, all reagents were warmed to room temperature (20-25degrees C) .  in a 96 v-bottom well plate, 25µL of assay buffer was added into the 8 standard wells and sample wells. Next 25µL of the standards will be added into the standard wells. 25µL of the supernatant samples that were frozen at -80 degrees C in an earlier protocol were thawed and added into the sample wells to test TNF-α, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. Following that, the bead cocktail that has been previously prepared was vortexed for 30 seconds and 25µL of the beads was added into each well. Each well was mixed by pipetting; the total volume in each well should contain 75µL. The plate was then sealed using a plate sealer and covered with aluminum foil to protect from light. Plate was incubated on a plate shaker at 800rpm for 2 hours at room temperature. After this incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 1050rpm for 5 minutes using a swinging bucket rotor with a microplate adapter. Immediately after centrifugation, the supernatant was disposed of in a biohazard waste container by quickly inverting the plate in one continuous and forceful motion, keeping the pellet intact. The plate was then washed using 200µL of the 1x wash buffer provided in the kit into each well and incubated for one minute. Then completed the centrifugation process and supernatant disposal two more times. Once the washing has been completed, 25µL of the detection antibodies from the kit were added into each well. The plate was then sealed with a new plate sealer and covered with aluminum once again. The plate was placed on a plate shaker at 800rpm for one hour at room temperature. After incubation, without performing a wash step, 25µL of SA-PE was added into each well. The plate was sealed with a plate sealer and wrapped in aluminum while on a plate shaker at 800 rpm for 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, the wash steps were completed twice by centrifuging the plate at 1050rpm, discarding supernatant, and adding 200µL of 1x wash buffer. Finally, 150µL of the 1X wash buffer is added into each well while resuspending beads by pipetting. The samples are then kept on ice and read through the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) the same day. To further analyze all data, FCS files obtained from the MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) were uploaded onto the BioLegend’s Data Analysis Software Suite for LEGENDplex. 

### I.	Osteoclast-Cell Like Differentiation 

Using the HL60- cell line, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate with a cell density of 1x106 before differentiating into osteoclasts. Cells were induced by 50 nM Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA; Catalog # 524400; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) and 10nM 1α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Vit D3; Catalog#H-089; Millipore Sigma, CA). Cells were allowed to incubate for 48 hours at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 

### J.	RANKL Expression Flow Cytometry

RANKL detection was confirmed using via surface antibody staining and detection by flow cytometry using a MACS Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). Using the cell pellets that were previously collected and kept on ice, each microcentrifuge tube contained an NLCs cell density of 1x106 cells. From there, 2.5µL of RANKL (G-1)-FITC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-377079) was added to each sample. 97.5µL of PBS/2% FBS was added to each sample and resuspended by pipetting. Samples were covered and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatant was decanted while the pellet was conserved. Cells were resuspended in 200 µL of PBS/2 % FBS to wash the cells and then centrifuged again. The wash step was completed twice. Once the washing has been performed, 150 µL of PBS/2 % FBS was added to each microcentrifuge tube and resuspended by pipetting. Each sample was transferred into a flow cytometer tube and kept on ice until analyzed by the flow cytometer the same day.

### K.	Analysis of CD11b and RANKL Surface Staining Using FlowJo

Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo Software (v10, BD Biosciences). The gating strategy included sequentially gating on viable target cells using forward  and side scatter, selecting singlets to exclude aggregates, and identifying CD11b positive NLCs. Fluorescent bead uptake was analyzed in CD11b positive cells by comparing FITC (CD11b) and PE (fluorescent beads) channels. Isotype-stained controls were used to establish gating thresholds. Gates were set based on forward and side scatter to exclude debris and doublets, and fluorescence signals were compared to isotype controls. 

### L.	Analysis of Inflammatory Cytokine Secretion Using LEGENDplex Software

Flow cytometry data obtained from the cytokine secretion assay were analyzed using the LEGENDplex  Data Analysis Software Suite (BioLegend). Standard samples were first analyzed to generate a standard curve for each cytokine. Experimental sample data files were then uploaded, and cytokine concentrations were automatically calculated by the software based on the corresponding standard curves. 

## Chapter 4: Results 
### A.	Establishment of Activated Neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) from HL-60 Promyelocytic Cell line 

To test the effects of the titanium-boron metal alloys on NLCs, the HL-60 cell line serves as a model for neutrophil response. The HL-60 cell line is a promyelocytic cell that can be differentiated into various cell types, such as neutrophil-like cells (NLCs), osteoclast-like cells, macrophage-like cells, etc. HL-60 cells are a good model used to study neutrophil behaviors and the differentiation process57. To achieve differentiation into NLCs, HL-60 cells were treated with 1.25% DMSO and 1µM of ATRA to the final concentration as previously described in the HL-60 differentiation into Neutrophil-Like Cells (NLCs) section. After 72 hours, cells began to exhibit morphological changes such as smaller size and irregular shape. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells are suspension cells and exhibit a rounder morphology (Figure ).

To confirm the differentiation of HL-60 cells into NLCs, flow cytometry analysis of CD11b was performed. CD11b was chosen due to it being a common neutrophil cell surface marker57. (Figure 21) shows the expression of CD11b. All experiments show CD11b expression is increased on HL-60 cells by more than 50% after a 72-hour treatment with 1.25% DMSO and 1µM of ATRA. In all trials, the HL-60 treated cells were stained with an IgG1 antibody to act as an isotype control shown in blue. The isotype is used to display any background binding that occurs when there is no specific target.  Undifferentiated HL-60 cells were stained with CD11b antibody to act as a negative control, shown in orange. HL-60 cells treated with ATRA and DMSO were stained with CD11b antibody and shown in red on the graphs (Figure 21).

### B.	Confirmation of the Phagocytic capability of NLCs from HL-60 cells Using Microscopy

To determine the capability of phagocytosis on NLCs, a phagocytosis assay was performed using 1µm fluorescent polychromatic beads. This assay was used to confirm whether differentiated HL-60 cells were capable of phagocytosing fluorescent beads, mimicking an in vivo periprosthetic environment. As seen in (Figure 22) ,it is difficult to determine whether the cells are phagocytosing the fluorescent beads. Ideally, successful phagocytosis would be indicated by the clear localization of bright fluorescent beads within the differentiated NLC. However, under the microscope, the beads were difficult to distinguish from extracellular debris, making it challenging to confirm internalization. Therefore, microscopy results were inconclusive, and an alternative approach was employed to verify phagocytic activity. 

### C.	Confirmation of the Phagocytic Capability of NLCs from HL-60 cells Using Flow Cytometry

Since visualization by microscopy was inconclusive and did not allow a reliable distinction between internalized and extracellular beads, flow cytometry was used as an alternative approach to confirm the phagocytic activity of neutrophil-like cells (NLCs). Flow cytometry enables single-cell analysis and separates true bead uptake from surface-bound or ambient fluorescence, providing a more definitive assessment of phagocytosis. 

Differentiated NLCs were incubated with fluorescent 1µm beads for 24 hours and analyzed using a multistep gating strategy (Figures 23-26). First, the main viable cell population was identified using forward and side scatter (FSC-A vs SSC-A). Singlet selection (FSC-A vs FSC-H) to remove doublets and aggregates. Within the singlet population, CD11 b-positive cells were gated to isolate differentiated NLCs. Bead uptake was then evaluated by comparing FITC (CD11b) to PE (fluorescent beads). 

Isotype controls established baseline fluorescence and quadrant boundaries (Figure 23). CD11b positive controls (Figure 24) established a baseline for positive NLC differentiation.  In bead-treated samples, a clear CD11b Positive/ PE population emerged in the upper-right quadrant, representing NLCs that had internalized fluorescent beads. For the 1:10 dilution bead dilution, 88.5% of DC11b positive events were bead positive (Figure 25), indicating robust phagocytic activity. The 1:100 bead dilution also demonstrated a measurable bead-positive NLC population, confirming that uptake occurred even under lower particle exposure (Figure 26).

Together, these results verify that HL-60-derived NLCs retain functional phagocytic capability. Flow cytometry provided a definite assessment of bead internalization and established that the differentiated NLC population is competent to respond to particulate material- an essential prerequisite for subsequent cytokine secretion and RANKL expression analyses.	 

### D.	Cytokine Secretion Assay 

Following confirmation of the phagocytic capability of HL-60 derived NLCs, the cells were subsequently cultured either in the presence of titanium alloy powders or on the surface of solid titanium alloy disks, as described Cytokine Secretion Assay of the Materials and Methods. Supernatants from each condition were and analyzed for the presence of TNF-ɑ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF  using a multiplex bead-based assay kit. Standard curves for each cytokine were generated to calculate their respective concentrations in the collected samples (Figure 27). Quantitative analysis revealed variations in the cytokine secretion profiles among the tested conditions, suggesting differential inflammatory responses to the titanium alloy materials. 

IL-1β secretion remained relatively low across all metal particle conditions at both 12- and 24-hour incubations (Figure 28).  Cytokine levels ranged from approximately 13.65- 309.91 pg/mL, with minimal variation between Ti-6Al-4V and the boron-modified alloys. No major time-dependent increase was observed; the addition of boron to Ti-6-Al-4V (0.5% or 1%) did not appear to substantially alter IL-1β release compared to the base alloy. NLCs and HL-60 controls produced minimal cytokine levels, while the LPS+ ATP positive control elicited the highest response, confirming assay responsiveness. 

TNF-  secretion varied among the metal particle conditions (Figure 28). At 12 hours, the Ti-6Al-4V + 0.5 % boron alloy produced the highest TNF- concentration (757.17pg/mL), followed by Ti-6Al-4V +1% B ( 693.47pg pg/mL) and  Ti-6Al-4V  boron showing the highest remaining concentration(556.69pg/mL). Untreated NLCs produced a baseline of 6785.56 pg/mL, while HL-60s and media controls produced low background of TNF-  (~262.41pg/mL). The LPS+ATP positive control induced the strongest response at 12 hours (5434.05pg/mL). These results indicate an early TNF-  peak at 12 hours that diminishes over time and show that boron incorporation does not uniformly enhance TNF- secretion across all concentrations or timepoints. 

IL-6 secretion showed more pronounced variability among conditions (Figure 28). Cells exposed to Ti-6Al-4V +0.5% B produced the highest IL-6 concentrations at both 12 and 24 hours (383.62/mL and 448.27pg/mL) followed by Ti-6Al-4V +1% B (365.31 pg/mL and 237.20 pg/mL). Ti-6Al-4V without boron generated lower IL-6 levels (253.76/mL and 362.07/mL)  relative to the boron-modified alloys.  Control groups, including HL-60 cells and media alone, remained near the limit of detection (†), while untreated NLCs produced moderate IL-6 levels (115.38pg/mL and 108.99pg/mL). The LPS control generated IL-6 levels comparable to NLCs alone. Overall, these results demonstrate that boron incorporation into Ti-6Al-4V enhances IL-6 secretion, with the strongest effect observed in the 0.5% boron alloy, while Ti-6Al-4V alone produced the lowest IL-6 secretion at both 12 and 24 hours. 

IL-8 secretion was the most robust among all cytokines measured (Figure 28). At 12 hours, the Ti-6Al-4V +1% boron alloy produced the highest IL-8 concentrations (31,121.28pg/mL)  followed by Ti-6Al-4V +0.5% B (28,778.91 pg/mL) at 24 hours. Ti-6Al-4V alone generated the lowest IL-8-inducing metal alloy. Untreated NLCs produced moderate IL-8 secretion (23,603.32pg/mL) while HL-60 cells and media resulted in minimal levels. By 24 hours, IL-8 levels declined across all metal conditions but remained highest in the boron-containing alloys. The LPS+ATP positive control yielded the greatest IL-8 response overall (274,867.3pg/mL). These results indicate that boron incorporation markedly increases IL-8 secretion compared to titanium alone and that IL-8 represents the most prominent inflammatory cytokine produced to metal particle exposure. 

GM-CSF levels remained below the limit of detection (†) in all metal particle-exposed at 12- and 24-hour incubations (6.87pg/mL) (Figure 28). Untreated NLCs, HL-60 cells, and media controls also fell below the limit of detection (6.87pg/mL), comparable to the LPS+ATP positive control generated a strong GM-CSF response at both 12- and 24-hour incubations (96.9 pg/mL and 284.79 pg/mL), confirming proper assay sensitivity. These findings indicate that metal particle exposure does not induce measurable GM-CSF  production by NLCs, suggesting that GM-CSF is not a major component of the neutrophil-like cell inflammatory response to the titanium-based alloys. 

IL-1ß secretion remained low across all metal disk conditions (Stainless steel, Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6Al-4V + 0.1% B, and Ti-6Al-4V + 1.09% B) at both 12- and 24-hour incubations (Figure 29). At 12-hour incubations, all metal conditions matched the NLC baseline, HL-60, and media controls (13.65pg/mL). At 24 hours, only minor increases were observed for stainless steel (16.18pg/mL), while all other disk conditions remained at detection limit values. In contrast, the LPS+ATP positive control generated noticeably elevated IL-1ß  concentrations at both time points (115.55pg/mL at 12 hours; 309.91pg/mL at 24 hours), confirming assay responsiveness. Overall, these findings indicate that none of the tested metal disks induced meaningful IL-1ß  secretion, suggesting minimal inflammasome activation under these exposure conditions. 

IL-6 secretion was strongly induced and varied across metal disk conditions (Figure 29). At 12 hours, the Ti-6Al-4V+ 0.1% boron disk produced the highest IL-6 concentration (712.92pg/mL), followed by Ti-6Al-4V  (310.68pg/mL). By 24 hours, IL-6 levels increased substantially across all metal disk conditions, with stainless steel eliciting the strongest response overall (1095.39pg/mL). Ti-6Al-4V+ 0.1% B and Ti-6Al-4V+ 1.09% B also produced high IL-6 levels at 24 hours (941.14pg/mL and 690.21pg/mL), whereas Ti-6Al-4V alone generated the lowest IL-6 secretion among the metal treatments (324.26pg/mL at 24 hours). Control groups including HL-60 cells, untreated NLCs, media and LPS showed minimal IL-6 secretion relative to metal-exposed NLCs. Overall, these findings indicate that metal disks robustly stimulate IL-6 production in NLCs, with stainless steel and boron modified titanium alloys inducing the strongest responses. 

TNF- was strongly induced by metal disk exposure, with clear differences between materials and timepoints (Figure 29).  At 12 hours, the Ti-6Al-4V boron alloy generated the highest TNF- secretion (2124.36/mL), followed by Ti-6Al-4V + 0.1%  (2122.24pg /mL) and the Ti-6Al-4V+ 1.09% boron alloy produced the lowest TNF- secretion among the metal disks (933.87pg/mL). By 24 hours, TNF- levels increased for several materials, with stainless steel eliciting the highest overall concentration (1077.75pg/mL), while the 0.1% boron alloy showed a moderate decline. Control groups including HL-60 cells, untreated NLCs, and media remained at baseline levels (262.41pg/mL). the LPS positive control produced a strong TNF- response at 12 hours (5434.05pg/mL) but declined substantially at 24 hours. Overall, this data indicates that metal disks strongly activate TNF- secretion in NLCs, particularly stainless steel and the 0.1% boron-modified alloy.

IL-8 secretion was the strongest cytokine response observed in NLCs exposed to metal disks (Figure 29). Among the metal conditions, Stainless steel produced the highest IL-8 levels at 12 hours (58050.64pg/mL). The Ti-6Al-4V+ 0.1% boron alloy and Ti-6Al-4V disks also induced robust IL-8 secretion among the metal disks ranging from  35,779-39,771pg/mL and 35,878- 58503 pg/mL. Untreated NLCs produced moderate IL-8 concentrations, (23,603.32pg/mL at 12 hours and 17396.22 pg/mL at 24 hours). While HL-60 cells and media controls exhibited minimal cytokine concentration levels. As expected, the LPS+ATP positive control generated extremely high IL-8 concentrations (146,964.3pg/mL at 12 hours and 17396.22 pg/mL at 24 hours), confirming assay sensitivity. Overall, this data indicates that boron modified titanium alloys, particularly the 1.09%B alloy, most strongly enhances IL-8 secretion, whereas unmodified Ti-6Al-4V elicits the weakest IL-8 response among metal disks. 

GM-CSF remained at the assay’s detection limit (†) for all metal disk conditions at 12 hour and 24-hour incubations. (Figure 29). Stainless steel, Ti-6Al-4V , and both boron-modified titanium alloys consistently produced GM-CSF concentrations of 6.87pg/mL, identical to HL-60 cells, untreated NLCs, and media controls. In contrast, the LPS+ATP positive control elicited a strong GM-CSF response (96.9pg/mL at 12 hours and 284.79pg/mL at 24 hours), confirming that the assay was functioning correctly. These findings indicate that NLCs do not produce detectable levels of GM-CSF in response to any of the metal disk materials tested, suggesting that GM-CSF is not a major component of the neutrophil-like cell response to solid titanium-based alloys or stainless steel under these experimental conditions. 

### E.	Establishment of RANKL in NLCs exposed to Metal Particles 

RANKL expression was evaluated after a 12-hour exposure of NLCs to titanium alloy particle samples (Figure 30). Across all particle conditions, RANL levels remained low and closely aligned with the isotype control (4.70%). Ti-6Al-4V particles induced 6.36% RANKL positive cells, while boron-modified alloys showed slightly higher but minimal levels with 7.78% for Ti-6Al-4V +0.5% B and 8.07% for Ti-6Al-4V+ 1% B. Baseline NLCs (6.58%) showed similar expression, indicating little to no RANKL induction from metal particle exposure. In contrast, the LPS+ ATP Positive control demonstrated a clear shift from 12.9% RANKL-positive cells, confirming that the assay could detect RANKL upregulation when present. These findings indicate that 12-hour exposure to titanium or titanium-boron particles does not significantly increase RANKL expression in NLCs above baseline levels. 

After 24 hours of exposure to metal particles, RANKL expression remained low across all tested conditions (Figure 31). Ti-6Al-4V particles yielded 1.05% RANKL-positive cells, while boron-containing particles showed similarly low levels at 1.12% (1%B) and 1.10% (0.5%B). These values were near or slightly above the isotype (1.37%), indicating no meaningful induction of RANKL at this time point. Baseline NLCs showed 0.78% RANKL positivity, confirming that NLCs naturally express very low RANKL even after extended culture. The LPS+ATP positive control produced only 1.76% RANKL-positive cells at 24 hours– lower than at 12 hours– indicating a transient RANKL induction that diminishes over time. Collectively, these results indicate that NLCs do not upregulate RANKL in response to titanium-based particles after 24 hours of exposure. 

Across both 12-hour and 24-hour incubations, metal particle exposure did not induce substantial RANKL expression in NLCs. Although a slight increase was observed at 12 hours, levels remained close to untreated NLCs and far above isotype only by a narrow margin. By 24 hours, RANKL expression decreased to about 1% for all particle conditions, comparable to baseline and isotype controls. The positive control demonstrated the highest expression at 12 hours but diminished by 24 hours, suggesting transient rather than sustained RANKL induction. Overall, these results indicate that NLCs do not express biologically meaningful levels of RANKL in response to metal particles and are unlikely to directly stimulate osteoclast progenitors through the RANK-RANKL pathway. 

### F.	Establishment of RANKL in NLCs exposed to Metal Disks

RANKL expression was elevated on NLCs after a 12-hour exposure to titanium alloy disks and stainless steel, and compared to untreated NLCs, isotype controls, and an LPS+ATP positive control (Figure 32). Across all metal conditions, RANKL expression remained low and closely clustered with the baseline NLC population and isotype control. Ti-6Al-4V induced 5.03% RANKL-positive cells, while the boron-modified alloys showed similarly minimal expression, with 5.46% in the 0.1%B condition and 6.30% in the 1.09% B condition. Stainless steel produced 5.27% RANKL-positive cells, compared to the untreated NLCs (5.59% RANKL-positive cells). In contrast, the LPS+ATP positive control generated the highest RANKL expression with 12.3%, confirming that the assay could detect upregulation when present. These results indicate that none of the metal disk materials tested induced substantial RANKL expression in NLCs within the 12-hour exposure period, suggesting minimal engagement of RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenic signaling under these conditions. 

RANKL expression was also assessed after a 24-hour exposure to titanium-based metal disks (Figure 33). Like the 12-hour results, RANKL levels remained low across all metal conditions and were only slightly higher than the isotype control. (3.78%). Titanium alloy disks produced 8.84% RANKL positive cells for Ti-6Al-4V and 5.97% for Ti-6Al-4V + 0.1% B, while the 1.09% boron alloy showed a modest increase to 7.64%. Stainless steel induced 5.24% RANKL-positive cells, compared to the untreated NLC baseline (5.99%). In contrast, the LPS+ ATP positive control showed a marked increase in RANKL expression (22.4%), confirming the assay’s ability to detect strong RANKL induction. Overall, metal disk exposure did not elevate RANKL expression beyond low baseline levels, indicating that NLCs do not upregulate RANKL in a biologically significant manner, even after extended exposure. 

Across both 12-hour and 24-hour incubations, exposure to titanium-based metal disks and stainless steel did not substantially increase RANKL expression in NLCs. At 12 hours, all disk conditions produced low RANKL levels ranging from 5-6%, comparable to untreated NLCs (5.59%) and only slightly above the isotype control (3.78%). After 24 hours, RANKL expression remained similarly low, ranging from 5-8% across all metal conditions, with values again closely overlapping with the baseline NLC expression (5.99%). Although the Ti-6Al-4V disk showed a modest increase from 8.824 at 24 hours, this level remained far below the strong induction observed in the LPS+ATP positive control (22.4%). Together, these findings demonstrate that metal disk exposures do not significantly elevate RANKL expression in NLCs at either time point. Indicating minimal activation of RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenic signaling and suggesting that NLCs are unlikely to directly stimulate osteoclast precursors through the RANK-RANKL pathway when interacting with these metals.

## Chapter 5 : Discussion

The need for improved prosthetic implant materials continues to grow in the United States, particularly among younger patients who live with these devices for decades-long biocompatibility of implant materials has become an increasingly critical concern64. Extended exposure to the warm, saline physiological environment accelerates corrosion and wear, releasing metal particles and ions into the periprosthetic space. These materials interact immediately with the innate immune system, yet the earliest cellular responders–neutrophils–remain far less studied than macrophages and fibroblasts, despite their abundance and rapid activation following implantation. Metal debris–induced inflammation is known to drive osteolytic loosening, a leading cause of implant failure, but the specific contributions of neutrophils to this process are poorly defined. This gap is especially relevant as new experimental alloys, such as titanium-boron compositions, are being developed with the goal of improving strength, corrosion resistance, and overall implant longevity. Understanding how neutrophil-like cells respond to established metals such as Ti-6Al-4V, stainless steel, and emerging boron-modified titanium alloys is essential for evaluating early inflammatory compatibility and guiding the design of next-generation prosthetic materials. 

### A. Early Findings and Assay Validation:

**Establishment of Neutrophil-Like Cells( NLCs) from HL-60 Cells**

Differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic cells into functional neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) was a critical first step in this study, as the validity of all subsequent assays depended on establishing a cell population that reliably models early neutrophil behavior. HL-60 cells are one of the most used human myeloid lines for generating NLCs because they grow easily, differentiate consistently, and develop strong neutrophil marker expression while maintaining good viability57.The differentiation protocol using All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and DMSO produced cells that exhibited characteristic neutrophil features, including reduced cell size, morphological changes, and increased expression of CD11b, a well-established marker of neutrophil differentiation that appears within 3 days57. Functional assays confirmed these NLCs displayed chemotactic, phagocytic, and oxidative burst responses, though with somewhat lower directional accuracy compared to primary neutrophils57. While HL-60 and its subline PLB-985 are genetically identical, they exhibit reproducible differences in gene expression that may make each better suited for a specific application.  Our flow cytometry analysis confirmed a substantial shift in CD11b-positive cells compared with the undifferentiated HL-60 cells and isotype controls, indicating a successful transition into a neutrophil-like phenotype. 

It is important to recognize the inherent limitations of this model system. Differentiated HL-60 cells do not fully recapitulate the short lifespan, complete granule composition or full cytokine repertoire of primary neutrophils.  However, they do provide a stable, reproducible model well suited for controlled in vitro environments, including metal exposure studies where primary neutrophils are difficult to maintain over extended periods of time68. Establishing a reliably differentiated NLC population, therefore, ensured that observed phagocytic, cytokine, and signaling responses reflected neutrophil-like behavior and allowed meaningful comparison of how different metal alloys influence early innate immune activation. 

**Phagocytosis Confirmation**

Phagocytosis assessment served as an essential verification that the differentiated neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) maintained a key functional behavior characteristic of primary neutrophils. Initial attempts to evaluate bead uptake by fluorescence microscopy were ultimately inconclusive– not because phagocytosis failed to occur, but because the fluorescence laser was not activated during the imaging. Specifically, the 1µm fluorescent polychromatic beads could not be reliably distinguished from the extracellular debris, making it impossible to confirm true internalization vs surface adherence or background artifacts (Figure 22).  Since the particles measured 1µm in size, which is smaller than a neutrophil (9-15µm), it was expected to have been phagocytosed and have induced an inflammatory response27,69,70. Consequently, microscopy could not provide the quantitative tool needed for this critical validation step.

To obtain a definitive and quantifiable assessment, flow cytometry was used as an alternative approach. Flow cytometry is established at the gold standard for quantifying phagocytosis because it eliminates ambiguity between surface binding and true internalization68. By gating for singlets and CD11b-positive NLCs and identifying dual positivity for CD11b and the fluorescent bead signal, flow cytometry confirmed a substantial population of bead-positive NLCs. The flow cytometry results demonstrated robust phagocytic capability: at high bead concentration (1:10 dilution), 78.36% of CD11b-positive NLCs were bead-positive in the upper right quadrant, confirming efficient internalization(Figure 25). Even at lower exposure (1:100 dilution), 68.72% of NLCs showed bead uptake (Figure 26). While these data confirm the phagocytic capability of differentiated NLCs, additional flow cytometry–based parameters may further refine the assessment of debris internalization. 

Although phagocytic activity in neutrophil-like cells was assessed using fluorescent bead uptake, an additional analytical approach that could further strengthen the evaluation of metal debris internalization is the use of side scatter (SSC) analysis by flow cytometry. Side scatter is a measure of cellular granularity and internal complexity and has been widely used as an indirect indicator of phagocytosis in granulocytes, including neutrophils. During phagocytosis, internalization of particulate material increases cytoplasmic complexity, resulting in a measurable elevation in SSC intensity. In the context of metal particle exposure, an increase in SSC among CD11b-positive NLCs could therefore serve as supportive evidence of debris uptake, particularly when direct visualization of internalized material is technically challenging. Incorporating SSC-based analysis in future experiments would allow for a label-free, quantitative assessment of phagocytic activity and could help distinguish true cellular internalization from extracellular particle adherence. Such an approach would complement fluorescence-based assays and provide additional insight into the extent to which neutrophils actively engulf implant-derived debris, an important early event in periprosthetic inflammatory signaling. 

This quantitative evidence demonstrated that differentiated NLCs were actively internalizing particulate material rather than merely binding it at the surface71. Establishing functional phagocytic activity was essential, as it validated that the NLC model could engage with metal debris in a manner analogous to primary neutrophils in the periprosthetic environment. Confirming this capability provided the necessary foundation for interpreting subsequent cytokine responses, which depend on successful internalization as the first step of neutrophil activation. 

**Cytokine Secretion**

Cytokine profiling revealed distinct activation patterns that depended on alloy composition. Across all the particle treatments tested, IL-8 emerged as the most prominently secreted cytokine, consistent with the strong chemotactic programming characteristic of differentiated HL-60 cells. Boron-modified titanium alloy particles–particularly the 1% boron formulation– further amplified IL-8 and IL-6 secretion, indicating enhanced inflammatory stimulation relative to unmodified Ti-6Al-4V. Particulate debris further increased IL-8 and IL-6 levels compared to control conditions. TNF-alpha was also induced by metal particles, although at more modest levels compared with IL-8, while IL-1ß and GM-CSF-mediated pathways in response to particulate debris. 

Exposure to solid metal disks produced a somewhat different cytokine landscape. Disk-format alloys elicited stronger IL-6 and IL-8 secretion overall, reflecting the greater surface area available to cell-material interaction. Stainless steel induced the most robust IL-6 and TNF-alpha responses, in line with its known higher corrosion potential and documented pro-inflammatory behavior. In contrast,  Ti-6Al-4V consistently produced the lowest cytokine output among disk conditions, suggesting comparatively weaker early neutrophil activation. Boron-integrated titanium disks, particularly higher-percentage formulations, again heightened IL-8 secretion, demonstrating that alloy composition plays a meaningful role in modulating neutrophil-derived chemotactic signaling. 

Together, these cytokine patterns indicate that neutrophil-like cells mount an early and cytokine-specific inflammatory response to metal alloys, with IL-8 serving as the dominant signal across both alloy forms. The heightened IL-6 and TNF-alpha output observed with certain alloys–especially stainless steel and boron-containing titanium-suggests that material chemistry and surface format significantly shape the magnitude of neutrophil activation. In general, particulate metals elicited lower cytokine release than their disk counter parts, suggesting that the continuous surface contact provided by metal disks may provoke stronger early neutrophil activation than dispersed particulate debris. This distinction highlights that boron alloy composition and physical format shape the inflammatory profile generated by neutrophil-like cells upon encountering implant materials. These findings help clarify how neutrophils contribute to the early inflammatory microenvironment surrounding their periprosthetic implants and highlight alloy-dependent differences that may hold relevance for long-term biocompatibility. Taken collectively, the results suggest that unmodified Ti-6Al-4V remains the most favorable option from a neutrophil inflammatory standpoint, as it consistently produced the lowest IL-6 and IL-8 secretion across both particle and disk exposures. By contrast, boron-modified titanium alloys, especially higher boron concentrations, amplified cytokine release, implying that increased boron content may come at the cost of stronger early inflammatory activation.

**RANKL Expression**

RANKL expression remained consistently low across all particle and disk exposures, indicating that neutrophil-like cells do not substantially upregulate this osteoclastogenic ligand in response to metal alloys. Both 12-hour and 24-hour time points showed RANKL levels comparable to untreated controls and only slightly above the isotype background. Conversely,  the LPS+ATP positive control demonstrated that the assay could detect true increases when present. These findings suggest that neither titanium alloys nor boron-modified variants stimulate RANKL-driven signaling pathways in neutrophils and therefore are unlikely to directly promote osteoclast differentiation through the RANK-RANKL axis. This outcome is consistent with the broader literature, which identifies macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblast-lineage cells, not neutrophils, as the predominant RANKL producers within the periprosthetic environment27,38,40. The minimal RANKL response observed here indicated that neutrophils, despite contributing to early inflammatory cytokine release, do not appear to act as direct initiators of osteoclastogenesis in the presence of metal debris or implant surfaces.

The observed differences in cytokine secretion and RANKL expression between 12-hour and 24-hour time points likely reflect distinct phases of neutrophil-like cell activation rather than experimental variability. Neutrophils are rapid responders of the innate immune system and are known to release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, and IL-8 shortly after exposure to inflammatory stimuli. These early responses are consistent with the 12-hour time point, which primarily captures acute neutrophil activation following contact with metal particles or solid implant surfaces. In contrast, RANKL expression represents a downstream osteoclastogenic signal that requires sustained cellular activation, transcriptional regulation, and in some cases, amplification by autocrine or paracrine cytokine signaling. The increased or altered RANKL expression observed at 24 hours, therefore, suggests a transition from an immediate inflammatory response toward a more osteoclast-supportive phenotype. This temporal shift is biologically relevant given the short lifespan of neutrophils in inflamed tissues, which typically ranges from 6 to 24 hours, and supports the concept that maximal RANKL expression occurs during later stages of neutrophil activation. Collectively, these findings indicate that early cytokine release may prime the local microenvironment for osteoclastogenesis, while sustained exposure to implant-derived materials promotes delayed RANKL expression that could contribute to pathological bone resorption in the periprosthetic setting. 

### Integration of Findings Within the Context of Periprosthetic Inflammation: 

**Neutrophils Compared to Macrophages and Fibroblasts**

The behavior of neutrophil-like cells must be interpreted within the broader framework of periprosthetic inflammation, where macrophages and fibroblasts have historically been considered the dominant contributors to osteolysis. Macrophages are the primary phagocytes responsible for detecting, engulfing, and responding to metal debris in vivo, and they are well documented to produce high levels of TNF-alpha, IL-ß, and RANKL that directly promote osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Fibroblasts in periprosthetic tissue similarly contribute to bone degradation through their production of RANKL and pro-fibrotic enzymes such as cathepsins and matrix metalloproteinases, enabling them to directly remodel or degrade bone without requiring osteoclasts72. In contrast, the low RANKL expression observed in neutrophil-like cells in this study indicates that neutrophils are unlikely to serve as direct osteoclastogenic cells. Instead, the data support a model in which neutrophils function primarily as early amplifiers of inflammation73,74. By rapidly migrating to implant surfaces, internalizing debris, and secreting cytokines that stimulate downstream effector cells, neutrophils help initiate the inflammatory environment that macrophages and fibroblasts later sustain and translate into osteolytic signaling75,76. This positioning of neutrophils as upstream modulators rather than direct bone-resorbing instigators aligns with current understanding of their short-lived but potent role in acute biomaterial-driven inflammation.

**Interpretation of Cytokine Profiles **

The cytokine secretion patterns observed in this study further clarify how neutrophils integrate into the periprosthetic immune network. The consistent dominance of IL-8 in nearly all metal conditions reflects the chemotactic nature of neutrophils, which rely heavily on IL-8 to recruit additional neutrophils to the sites of foreign exposures77,78. This creates a positive feedback loop that amplifies neutrophil accumulation and prolongs early inflammation. The simultaneous production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha–especially in response to stainless steel and boron-containing titanium alloys suggests that neutrophils help prime macrophages, fibroblasts, and stromal cells to increase their inflammatory output. Both IL-6 and TNF-alpha are known to enhance RANKL expression in fibroblasts and osteoblast-lineage cells, meaning that the cytokines secreted by neutrophils can indirectly promote osteoclastogenesis, even though NLCs themselves did not upregulate RANKL79–81. Conversely, the near absence of IL-1ß indicates that the inflammasome pathway was not strongly activated in these cells under the tested conditions, and the low GM-CSF levels suggest neutrophils did not substantially influence monocyte differentiation82. Together, these cytokine patterns place neutrophils as key early contributors whose signaling initiates and shapes the inflammatory trajectory that other cells later convert into bone-resorbing outcomes75,83.

**Influence of Material Format: Particles versus Disks**

Comparing particulate and disk format materials reveals an important dimension of neutrophil activation. Disk format metals consistently induced stronger cytokine responses than particulate debris, particularly for IL-6 and IL-8. This likely reflects the continuous and stable cell-surface interaction provided by disk materials, which allows for neutrophil-like cells to adhere and activate across a larger contact area84. In contrast, particulate metals stimulate the smaller, mobile wear debris generated during long-term prosthetic use; these particles induce weaker and more intermittent stimulation, resulting in lower cytokine output. This pattern aligns with prior findings that larger or more stable biomaterial interfaces enhance neutrophil activation by providing more consistent engagement with pattern recognition receptors, integrins, and cytoskeletal pathways. These observations underscore the importance of evaluating not only alloy chemistry but also physical geometry when predicting neutrophil behavior at the implant surface. 

**Implications for Implant Longevity and Osteolysis**

Understanding neutrophil responses to metal alloys is critical for predicting material biocompatibility and long-term implant success. The strong IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-alpha signals produced in response to certain alloys, particularly those with higher boron content or stainless steel, may accelerate the transition from acute inflammation to chronic macrophage and fibroblast-driven osteolysis85. Early neutrophil activation can prime downstream cells to increase RANKL expression, amplify recruitment of inflammatory populations, and facilitate the formation of a microenvironment conducive to bone resorption75,86,87. Conversely, alloys that trigger weaker neutrophil activation, such as unmodified Ti-6Al-4V, may reduce the inflammatory burden at the implant interface and help mitigate long-term osteolytic risk. These findings position neutrophils as gatekeepers of the inflammatory cascade: while not directly responsible for bone resorption, their cytokine output likely influences the intensity and duration of the inflammatory response that ultimately determines implant stability or loosening75,88.

### C. Promising Metals

Interpreting these findings through the lens of early innate immune activation reveals clear differences in the biocompatibility of the metals tested. Across both particulate and disk formats, unmodified Ti-6Al-4V consistently elicited the lowest inflammatory response from neutrophil-like cells. This alloy produced the weakest IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, the lowest TNF-alpha output in the disk format and did not induce RANKL expression at either time point. These characteristics suggest that Ti-6Al-4V creates a comparatively mild inflammatory stimulus and is therefore the most favorable alloy tested from a neutrophil-centered biocompatibility standpoint89. Given that neutrophils act as early amplifiers of inflammation, materials that minimize neutrophil activation may help reduce downstream macrophage and fibroblast-driven osteolysis, positioning Ti-6Al-4V as a strong candidate for maintaining long-term implant stability89,90. 

In contrast, stainless steel produced the most robust inflammatory activation among all tested metals. It generated the highest IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion in the disk format and produced strong IL-8 output across conditions. These findings align with stainless steels known susceptibility to corrosion and ion release, which are recognized contributors to heightened inflammatory signaling in periprosthetic tissues91. The strong neutrophil response observed here supports existing concerns about stainless steel's biocompatibility and suggests that it may exacerbate early inflammation in ways that could accelerate osteolytic processes92,93. 

Boron-modified titanium alloys showed an intermediate pattern, in which increased boron incorporation consistently amplified inflammatory cytokine release, particularly IL-6 and IL-8, without triggering RANKL expression. Higher boron concentrations produced cytokine elevations, indicating that the mechanical benefits obtained by adding boron may come at the cost of stronger acute inflammatory activation. While these findings suggest that high boron alloys may be less favorable from a neutrophil activation standpoint, it is important to consider that boron-containing alloys may still offer advantages for other cell types or mechanical performance parameters. For example, boron is known to improve hardness, wear resistance, and grain refinement, which may translate into longer implant lifespan or reduced wear debris generation66. Thus, although boron alloys appear suboptimal specifically for neutrophil-mediated inflammation, lower boron concentrations could represent a compromise candidate for future alloy development, balancing improved material properties with more moderate immunological activation. 

Overall, this comparative analysis highlights that Ti-6Al-4V remains the most promising alloy tested for minimizing early neutrophil activation, a key factor in reducing the inflammatory cascade that leads to osteolysis. Stainless steel appears least favorable due to its strong pro-inflammatory signaling, while boron-modified alloys require careful optimization to mitigate cytokine-driven inflammatory responses while preserving their mechanical advantages. These findings provide a useful foundation for guiding alloy selection and further engineering of next-generation biomaterials. 

### D. Other measures of Biocompatibility 

Although neutrophil activation represents an important component of early innate immune responses to implant materials, biocompatibility is a multifaceted property that depends on numerous cellular and physicochemical factors. The inflammatory profiles generated by neutrophil-like cells provide initial insight into how implants may influence early tissue responses, but a comprehensive evaluation of biomaterial performance requires consideration of cytotoxicity, corrosion behavior, surface mechanics, and the responses of additional periprosthetic cell types. These factors collectively determine whether an implant maintains long-term stability or contributes to osteolytic loosening. 

**Cytotoxicity and cell Viability**

Beyond cytokine secretion, the cytotoxic potential of an alloy plays a major role in its overall biocompatibility. Viability assays and apoptosis analyses– such as caspase activation or metabolic activity tests were not included in the present study but represent important future directions. Excessive ion release, surface reactivity, or particulate debris can induce apoptosis or necrosis in immune and stromal cells. Cytotoxic environments may also impair the healing response at the bone–implant interface and disrupt homeostatic remodeling processes92. Quantifying the survival of neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblast-lineage cells in response to these metals would provide a more complete understanding of how alloy chemistry influences cellular health beyond inflammatory activation alone. 

**Corrosion Resistance and Ion Release**

Corrosion behavior is another critical parameter influencing implant longevity and tissue compatibility94,95. Alloys with poor corrosion resistance may undergo surface pitting oxide-layer disruption, or galvanic interactions, resulting in the release of metal ions into the periprosthetic space. These ions can promote inflammation, oxidative stress, and long-term cellular dysfunction. Stainless steel, for example, is known to corrode more readily than titanium alloys, which aligns with its stronger pro-inflammatory profile in the present study. Conversely, titanium-based alloys generally exhibit more stable oxide layers and lower ion release rates96. Future work incorporating electrochemical corrosion testing or ion quantification would be valuable for correlating cytokine responses with actual metal release patterns. Such data would help determine whether increased inflammation is a result of alloy surface chemistry. 

**Mechanotransduction and Surface Roughness**

Surface topography and mechanical cues can also play important roles in neutrophil activation and overall implant integration89,97. Rougher surfaces can enhance neutrophil adhesion, spreading, and degranulation, which may amplify cytokine secretion89,98. The differences observed between disk format metals and particulate debris in this study reflect this principle: disks provide a continuous surface that favors sustained neutrophil engagement, whereas smaller particles create transient, less stable interactions. These mechanodestructive effects are known to influence macrophage polarization, fibroblast activation, and osteoblast proliferation as well99. Incorporating surface characterization techniques such as profilometry or SEM would allow future studies to examine how material structure contributes to cytokine output and cellular compatibility.

**Effects on Other Periprosthetic Cell Types**

A complete Assessment of Alloy biocompatibility must also account for how metal Materials Influence other Cell Types that contribute to periprosthetic inflammation and bone remodeling. Macrophages, for instance, are potent producers of RANKL and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and they drive much of the chronic osteoclastogenic signaling observed in osteolysis100. Fibroblasts within the periprosthetic membrane are now recognized as major contributors to RANKL production and can directly degrade bone matrix through the secretion of proteolytic enzymes101. Osteoblasts regulate bone formation and produce RANKL in response to inflammatory stimuli, while osteoclast precursors rely on RANK-RANKL interactions to differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Because neutrophils do not appear to upregulate RANKL in response to metal exposure, their contributions are likely indirect, mediated through cytokine stimulation of these downstream effector cells102. Future studies integrating co-culture models and comparing responses across cell types would be essential for determining how alloy chemistry shapes the multicellular environment that influences implant stability or loosening. 

### E. Future Directions 

The findings of this study establish a foundation for understanding early neutrophil responses to titanium-based alloys, but also highlight several avenues for future research that are necessary to build a more comprehensive picture of periprosthetic immunity and biomaterial biocompatibility. First, expanding these experiments to include primary human neutrophils would improve physiological relevance and help validate whether the cytokine patterns observed in HL-60-derived NLCs accurately reflect responses of native innate immune cells. Primary neutrophils possess distinct activation thresholds, short lifespans, and unique epigenetic profiles that may yield different inflammatory signatures than immortalized cell lines57,103. 

Another important direction is the direct measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a hallmark of neutrophil activation and a major contributor to oxidative stress at implant surfaces. Quantifying ROS production in response to different alloy compositions would help contextualize cytokine data and clarify whether elevated IL-6 and IL-8 levels correspond to greater oxidative reactivity. Additionally, incorporating dose-response experiments for both metal particles and metal disks would provide insight into how increasing debris loads or ion concentration influences neutrophil activation, better reflecting the graded exposure that occurs with implant wear over time.

A critical next step would be the development of co-culture models that incorporate macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, or osteoclast precursors. Because neutrophils do not produce RANKL, their contributions to osteolysis are likely indirect and mediated through cytokine-driven modulation of other cell types in this context. Co-culture or sequential stimulation systems would enable mechanistic testing of how neutrophil-derived IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-8 influences downstream osteoclastogenic pathways.

Methodologically, the use of live-cell imaging–either confocal or high-resolution time-lapse microscopy– would allow visualization of real-time particle uptake, adhesion dynamics, and neutrophil behavioral changes in response to alloy surfaces. Coupling this with experiments that systematically vary surface roughness or topography would help disentangle the contributions of mechanotransduction from those of alloy chemistry.

Finally, expanding the range of metal compositions tested, including additional titanium-boron alloy ratios, alternative alloying elements, or ceramic and polymer coatings, would provide broader insight into how materials engineering choices affect early immune compatibility. Such work would support the long-term goal of identifying or designing alloys that minimize inflammatory activation while maintaining the mechanical strength required for prosthetic performance. 

Collectively, these future directions will help bridge the gap between in vitro findings and the complex multicellular environment of the periprosthetic space, enabling more accurate predictions of implant performance and supporting the development of next-generation biomaterials with improved biocompatibility. 

### F. Limitations

Although this study provides important insight into the early neutrophil response to titanium-based alloys, several limitations must be considered when interpreting the findings. First, HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells do not fully replicate the biology of primary human neutrophils68,104. Differentiated HL-60 cells possess altered gene expression profiles, extended lifespan, and distinct activation thresholds, particularly with respect to cytokine secretion57. Their intrinsically high IL-8 output and comparatively low IL-1ß and GM-CSF production may not accurately reflect the full spectrum of responses observed in primary circulating neutrophils. Additionally, primary neutrophils survive only 6-10 hours in the bloodstream, whereas HL-60-derived neutrophils remain viable over longer periods; this is the 12-24 hour time points used here may overestimate or distort the duration of neutrophil activity relative to physiological conditions57,59,68.

Second, this study measured only five cytokines– TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF– providing only a partial view of the inflammatory landscape. Important regulatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-alpha, and others were not included in the panel, limiting the ability to capture anti-inflammatory signaling, monocyte recruitment, or macrophage polarization cues that may be relevant to implant-associated inflammation15,59,64. Similarly, reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major component of neutrophil activation and biomaterial response, were not directly assessed. ROS generation is known to influence cytokine production, oxidative damage, and downstream cell signaling, and its absence represents an important gap in understanding neutrophil-material interactions. 

Third, metal exposures were performed using a single concentration for both particles and disks. While these conditions provided a consistent comparison across alloy types, they do not capture the dose-dependent variability expected in vivo, whereas ion release and debris generation fluctuate over time and differ among patients. Incorporating dose-response experiments would strengthen predictions regarding alloy behavior under varied physiological loads. Furthermore, only early time points were examined. Longer-term cytokine kinetics (48-72 hours) would offer a more complete understanding of how NLCs activation evolves and whether inflammatory signals persist, resolve, or transition into secondary signaling cascades that influence macrophages or fibroblasts. 

Finally, this study examined neutrophils in isolation rather than in combination with other periprosthetic cell types. In vivo, neutrophils interact with macrophages, fibroblasts, mesenchymal stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclast precursors– cell types that respond to neutrophil-derived cytokines and, in turn, reinforce or suppress inflammation. Co-culture models or sequential stimulation systems would therefore provide a more physiologically relevant representation of cellular crosstalk in periprosthetic tissue. Without these models, the current findings capture only the neutrophil-specific contribution and cannot fully predict how downstream cell populations respond to different alloy compositions.

### G. Final Conclusions 

Taken together, the findings of this study position neutrophils as influential early responders in the inflammatory cascade surrounding prosthetic implants. Although they do not directly initiate osteoclastogenic signaling through RANKL production, their rapid secretion of cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-alpha can amplify local inflammation and shape the behavior of macrophages, fibroblasts, and other downstream effector cells. All metal compositions tested were capable of eliciting some degree of neutrophil activation, but unmodified Ti-6Al-4V consistently produced the lowest cytokine levels, suggesting that it remains the most favorable alloy for minimizing early inflammatory burden. In contrast, the incorporation of boron–while known to enhance mechanical properties and wear resistance– heightened neutrophil-derived cytokine release, indicating that improvements in material strength may come at the cost of increased early immune activation. 

These observations highlight the value of neutrophil responses as an early screening tool for assessing the biocompatibility of emerging implant alloys. Because neutrophils are among the first cells to encounter implant surfaces, alloys that limit neutrophil activation may reduce the likelihood of triggering the inflammatory responses that precede chronic osteolysis. Overall, the data presented here support the continued use of titanium alloys lacking boron as a preferred option for minimizing early inflammatory responses, while emphasizing the need for careful optimization when incorporating additional alloying elements. By integrating neutrophil biology into materials evaluation, future biomaterial development can better balance mechanical performance with immune compatibility, ultimately improving long-term implant outcomes.
