### Neutrophil-like Cells Response to Experimental Metal Alloys

**Department of Biological Sciences|California State Polytechnic University, Pomona**

## Abstract

The demand for prosthetics has gradually increased with the need for implants and the advancements in technology, making them more accessible to the growing population in the United States. Prosthetic recipients have become increasingly younger over time, resulting in a longer duration of implant use among this demographic. The extended implant duration within the physiological environment in the body can result in corrosion of the metal alloy. Metal debris resulting from the corrosion can induce an inflammatory response that can lead to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption around the implant. Bone resorption is the process of bone tissue dissolving through the action of specialized bone remodeling cells called osteoclasts. Monocytes and macrophages are precursors for osteoclast cells. One of the key signals in osteoclast formation is the activation of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa  (RANK) on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells, by RANK ligand (RANKL) on other cells, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. This ligand plays a crucial role by binding to the RANK receptors found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages, promoting their differentiation into osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts will attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid that degrades the bone. When this phenomenon occurs on the periphery, it causes osteolytic loosening. Different cell types are involved in the activation of bone resorption, including osteoclasts, macrophages, and fibroblasts, but it is not entirely known how neutrophils play a role in this process. Neutrophils are one of the first responders of the immune system in the presence of an antigen. They secrete many of the same cytokines as macrophages and fibroblasts that aid in osteoclast activation. It is unknown whether neutrophils detect metal debris resulting from implant corrosion or whether they are induced into an inflammatory response. This study seeks to provide more knowledge on neutrophil function in the presence of new metal alloys that could potentially be used for prosthetic implants. HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) were exposed to titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V), and novel titanium-boron alloys. Upon exposure, phagocytosis activity was analyzed along with inflammatory cytokine secretion using a cytometric bead array, and expression of NLC RANKL by flow cytometry. This is a comparative analysis of a series of metal alloys to determine which of them activates neutrophils the least, potentially making for a more biocompatible metal.

### A. Prosthesis 

A prosthesis is an artificial device used to replace a missing or no longer functional body part (Figure 1). Reasons why many people obtain a prosthesis are due to amputations, age, injuries, and diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Prostheses nowadays can be made from a variety of metal alloys that each have benefits and disadvantages. 


### B. History of Prosthesis

Prostheses have been used for a large portion of history. It is unknown when the first prosthetic was created, but the oldest known prosthesis that has been identified is from ancient Egypt. One toe was made from papier-mache but would not bend, while another toe was created using wood and leather (Figure 2).  It was believed that prosthetics were created for cosmetic purposes rather than functionality. In Italy, at approximately 300 B.C., a prosthetic leg was made from bronze, hollowed wood, and leather straps. During the 16th century, the first functional prosthetic was created for soldiers who were coming off the battlefield1. During the American Civil War in 1860, the high number of amputees from the war caused a spike in prosthetic patents to quadruple. Figure 3 displays an artificial leg used by soldiers during the American Civil War. Throughout the 15th and 19th centuries, France and Switzerland began making prosthetics that were more functional by using cables, gears, and springs. Later in the 1900s, manufacturers were producing more functional prosthetics with more artificial materials like plastic, aluminum, titanium, and silicone to make the products lightweight and durable. 

### C.	Metals Used in Prosthesis  

As technology has advanced through the ages, more alterations have been made for patients that aid in users’ needs, such as pain reduction, mobility, and independence2.  Availability, cost, mechanical properties, and longevity must be part of the criteria for a successful prosthetic implant. Today, implant prosthetics are being made using materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and cobalt chrome 3. All metals used present a unique outcome due to the corrosion properties of the prosthetic after being implanted into a warm, wet, and salty environment, compounded by the natural movement of the body. Corrosion of such metal alloys may result in further complications for the user. These may include an inflammatory response that causes bone erosion, prosthetic failure, and the user receiving an entirely new prosthetic implant. Certain standards are required to establish a biocompatible metal. When metals are implanted into the patient, their positive charge is attracted to the negative charge of chloride ions in the human body. The chloride ions will pull titanium or iron or any positively charged metal out of the implant, leading to the accumulation of wear debris in the body. The free metal ions can also create harmful effects in surrounding tissues, including DNA damage. Moreover, high concentrations of metal ions have been shown to induce cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, etc., while minimal levels of metal concentration can initiate cytokine release. 

Titanium (Ti) is widely utilized for its exceptional biocompatibility, which significantly minimizes the risks of adverse reactions post-implantation surgery3. Upon exposure to physiological conditions, titanium forms a stable oxide layer on its surface, contributing to the enhancement of biocompatibility and promoting integration with surrounding tissues 4. The metal also exhibits favorable mechanical properties such as high strength and stiffness, making it suitable for load-bearing biomedical applications. The oxidation process is a key factor in its success as a biomaterial. However, titanium alone is relatively softer compared to titanium alloys.  Titanium alloys, such as 90% Titanium- 6% Aluminum- 4% Vanadium (Ti6Al4V) are commonly used for prosthetic implants (Figure 4). For this alloy, once the superoxide layer is broken, the metal ions are attracted to the Cl ions, and the Ti ions escape through the fracture and into the body. The Ti ions bind to oxygen, creating TiO2 debris, which causes an immune response.(Figure 5). Newer titanium alloys may be a better option, analyzing them for more strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility overall. 

Stainless steel is a metal alloy composed of chromium, nickel, and small amounts of  molybdenum 5 6. This alloy possesses a high resistance to corrosion 7 and is commonly used in surgical implants8,9 (Figure 6). It has low strength and ductility but can be very expensive to make.

 Cobalt Chrome is a very toxic metal alloy, but is also commonly used in medical implants due to its low chemical inertness and high corrosion resistance (Figure 7)10. The degradation through wear corrosion releases ions that can result in elevated levels of cobalt chrome in the body. Cobalt is highly toxic when concentrated at 7-10µg/L 3 or above.  The wear can become toxic, creating an immune response and leading to osteolytic loosening. It affects the immune system, is a carcinogen, induces cardiotoxicity, and causes mutagenesis.
 
### D. Demand for Prosthetics 

Prosthetic implants are steadily increasing in demand as the population ages and people’s bodies require structural reinforcement or replacements. The increasing demand is due to traumatic and non-traumatic causes of limb loss, and complications with current prosthetic implants. Current estimates indicate that 1.9 million individuals in the United States live with limb loss. This number is expected to double to 3.6 million people by 2050 11. Out of the growing patient population, only 15% of individuals with amputations currently have access to prosthetic devices 12, highlighting a disparity in healthcare availability for individuals with amputations. 

The underlying causes of limb loss are diverse, but can be categorized as trauma, cancer, infections, and vascular diseases 13,14. Among the complications associated with limb loss, bone resorption is one of the biological challenges that limits the longevity of prosthetic implants. Patients who receive prosthetic joint implants frequently require revision surgeries, replacement of the prosthetic, when bone resorption weakens the implant’s support. Current statistics show that over 10% of the patients who acquire total joint replacements require revision surgeries due to implant failures caused by osteolytic loosening15. These statistics demonstrate the downsides of metals that induce immune stimulation, which leads to bone degradation and shortened prosthetic implant longevity for patients.  

### E.	Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
An arthroplasty is a surgical procedure performed to restore the joint using a prosthetic implant (Figure 8). The procedure is intended to restore the function of the joint by improving mobility, reducing pain, and enhancing quality of life for patients. Among all prosthetic implant surgeries, total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are the most common prosthetic implants required by patients. Patients who undergo the procedure experience a relief from joint pain and functional improvement as long as the implant does not corrode. Weight-bearing implants such as these typically last approximately 15 years. 
In a total hip arthroplasty (THA), the damaged or diseased portion of the hip joint is replaced with artificial components. It is predicted that by the year 2030, there will be over 635,000 procedures performed annually in the United States16. Similarly, a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure where the damaged part of the knee joint is replaced with artificial implants. By the year 2030, more than 1.26 million TKA procedures will be conducted annually in the United States16,17. Recent Medicare projections predict that by 2040, THAs are expected to exceed 719,000 annually, while TKAs over 1.22 million17. By the year 2060,  it is expected that 2 million THAs and 3 million TKA procedures will be performed annually17.

Although primary arthroplasty procedures are successful, there are still complications that remain a challenge. Some of the most common complications following THA or TKA include biofilm formation on the metal, aseptic loosening, dislocation of the implant, infection, osteolysis from wear debris, sciatic nerve injuries, and insufficient bone bonding between bone and prosthesis 5. These complications often require revision surgeries, carrying a higher risk, higher cost, more physical therapy, and possibly associated with less favorable outcomes compared to the primary implant. Medicare projections show that the number of revision procedures is lower in number than primary procedures, with their rates still being substantial. It is expected that by the year 2040, about 43,5000 cases of THA revision surgeries will occur annually, and TKA revision surgeries will exceed nearly 115,000 cases per year 16. Correspondingly, by the year 2060, it is expected to nearly reach 62,000 cases of THA revision surgeries annually, while about 287,000 cases of THA revision surgeries would occur per year (Figure 9)16. 

These projections demonstrate the increasing demand for primary arthroplasties due to an aging population and the burden of added revision arthroplasties because of implant failure. This indicates a critical reason to find a durable biocompatible material that will prevent prosthetic failure, reduce the risk of revision surgeries, and enhance implant longevity.

### F.	Cost of Prosthetic Implants

The cost of prosthetic implants can be a burden to most patients, especially those who have no access to health care. Studies show that physical hip implants may range between $2,392 - $12,65118 while physical knee implants cost between $1,797- $12,093 18. Total joint arthroplasties are one of the largest expenditures in health care during the year with 1.5 million cases happening in the United States 18. 

The expenditure for the total arthroplasty procedures is actively rising throughout the years.  Statistics show that the cost for a primary TKA or THA with no complications is approximately $39,927- $195,264 19. However, when revision surgeries occur, the costs increase significantly, ranging from $58,967- $247,715, not including any complications that may occur during the procedure 19. One of the main challenges with the cost is the lack of transparency between physicians who did not have the accurate knowledge of the prices from different implant options. Many orthopedic providers believed that the more expensive implants had higher clinical value than the less expensive options. The lack of knowledge and awareness may contribute to the heightened healthcare spending. With the cost of these procedures, many low-income or uninsured individuals are avoiding the surgery, which leads them to more pain and less mobility. 

### G.	Complications with Prosthetic Implants

Complications that may arise with the use of prosthetic implants include both mechanical failures and biological responses, often resulting in implant failure requiring revision surgery. This occurs when the first implant stops working properly, and an additional surgery is required to replace the failing implant and insert a new one. Revision surgeries are common with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties, where metal debris can lead to implant failure, pseudotumor,  and soft tissue necrosis20. Inflammatory responses also occur in the presence of implants, where macrophages, fibroblasts, and neutrophils appear at the site of infection to fight off foreign invaders. This reaction contributes to osteolytic loosening, one of the primary biological causes of implant failure21. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is reported in roughly 0.5-2% of primary hip and knee arthroplasties, with incidence rising 4-5% after revision procedures and reaching as high as 20% among revision indications22,23. Early stage infections are most common within the first two years, where reported rates range from 0.8-2.1% for primary hip arthroplasty24. The infection rates underscore the clinical burden of PJI and its contribution to the need for revision surgery. 

Mechanical complications present a challenge among prosthetic implants. Corrosion can occur at implant sites where repetitive movement may cause the prosthetic to rub against the bone, releasing metal debris particles that spread into surrounding tissues20. Colonization of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis may also occur as a complication that can lead to infection and in some cases, revision surgery (Figure 10)25. 

With new advancements, the amount of wear debris production in the body has reduced and has increased overall implant longevity. Nevertheless, complication rates remain higher in revision arthroplasties compared to primary procedures, especially in TKA, where vascular and infection-related risks are elevated26.
