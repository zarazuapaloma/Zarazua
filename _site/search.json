    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nMy name is Paloma Zarazua, a Master’s degree candidate at Cal Poly Pomona.\nMy research interests lie in immunology, hematopoietic cells, and solving biomedical problems. I’m especially curious about the organ shortage crisis and how it might be resolved through organogenesis—the process of forming organs. This topic fascinates me because researchers have discovered ways to use various plant tissues, like spinach leaves and bamboo, to create frameworks for cardiovascular tissue and bone structure. I hope to one day contribute to this area of research and help address the organ shortage. While we may never completely solve the problem, I believe that helping even a few patients receive an organ or shorten their wait time can make a lasting impact.\nBeyond research, I enjoy baking and creating new recipes. Before entering the lab, I never realized that baking was a science. When experiments in the lab failed, I found myself feeling similar to when my baking doesn’t turn out the way I anticipated. Whether I failed at making a pastry or an experiment, I kept trying until I succeeded. I’ve come to love it. I also enjoy tutoring and teaching. As a graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona, I’ve had the opportunity to teach students from diverse backgrounds in courses like Human Physiology, Life Science, and Foundations of Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity. I’ve also taught fellow lab members molecular techniques and tissue culture. As a future professor, I hope to continue supporting students and colleagues by fostering a strong, inclusive scientific community.\nMy career goal is to become a professor and run my own research lab focused on molecular biology techniques. I want to train future scientists and collaborate with medical teams working on organ-related challenges.\nOn this site, you’ll find updates on my research and my journey. I’ll be sharing more about my background, lab experiences, and the scientific questions that drive me.\n\n\n\n\n Connect with me on LinkedIn"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe demand for prosthetics has gradually increased with the need for implants and the advancements in technology, making them more accessible to the growing population in the United States. Prosthetic recipients have become increasingly younger over time, resulting in a longer duration of implant use among this demographic. The extended implant duration within the physiological environment in the body can result in corrosion of the metal alloy. Metal debris resulting from the corrosion can induce an inflammatory response that can lead to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption around the implant. Bone resorption is the process of bone tissue dissolving through the action of specialized bone remodeling cells called osteoclasts. Monocytes and macrophages are precursors for osteoclast cells. One of the key signals in osteoclast formation is the activation of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa  (RANK) on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells, by RANK ligand (RANKL) on other cells, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. This ligand plays a crucial role by binding to the RANK receptors found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages, promoting their differentiation into osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts will attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid that degrades the bone. When this phenomenon occurs on the periphery, it causes osteolytic loosening. Different cell types are involved in the activation of bone resorption, including osteoclasts, macrophages, and fibroblasts, but it is not entirely known how neutrophils play a role in this process. Neutrophils are one of the first responders of the immune system in the presence of an antigen. They secrete many of the same cytokines as macrophages and fibroblasts that aid in osteoclast activation. It is unknown whether neutrophils detect metal debris resulting from implant corrosion or whether they are induced into an inflammatory response. This study seeks to provide more knowledge on neutrophil function in the presence of new metal alloys that could potentially be used for prosthetic implants. HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) were exposed to titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V), and novel titanium-boron alloys. Upon exposure, phagocytosis activity was analyzed along with inflammatory cytokine secretion using a cytometric bead array, and expression of NLC RANKL by flow cytometry. This is a comparative analysis of a series of metal alloys to determine which of them activates neutrophils the least, potentially making for a more biocompatible metal."
