    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nMy name is Paloma Zarazua, a Master’s degree candidate at Cal Poly Pomona.\nMy research interests lie in immunology, hematopoietic cells, and solving biomedical problems. I’m especially curious about the organ shortage crisis and how it might be resolved through organogenesis—the process of forming organs. This topic fascinates me because researchers have discovered ways to use various plant tissues, like spinach leaves and bamboo, to create frameworks for cardiovascular tissue. I hope to one day contribute to this area of research and help address the organ shortage. While we may never completely solve the problem, I believe that helping even a few patients receive an organ or shorten their wait time can make a lasting impact.\nBeyond research, I enjoy baking and creating new recipes. Before entering the lab, I never realized that baking was a science. When experiments in the lab failed, I found satisfaction in baking—where results were often more predictable and rewarding. I’ve come to love it. I also enjoy tutoring and teaching. As a graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona, I’ve had the opportunity to teach students from diverse backgrounds in courses like Human Physiology, Life Science, and Foundations of Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity. I’ve also taught fellow lab members molecular techniques and tissue culture. As a future professor, I hope to continue supporting students and colleagues by fostering a strong, inclusive scientific community.\nMy career goal is to become a professor and run my own research lab focused on molecular biology techniques. I want to train future scientists and collaborate with medical teams working on organ-related challenges.\nOn this site, you’ll find updates on my research and my journey. I’ll be sharing more about my background, lab experiences, and the scientific questions that drive me.\n\n\n\n\n Connect with me on LinkedIn"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe demand for prosthetics has gradually increased with the advancements in technology, making them more accessible to the growing population in the United States. Prosthetic recipients have become increasingly younger over time, resulting in a longer duration of implant use among this demographic. The extended implant duration can result in corrosion of the metal alloy, creating an inflammatory response which can lead to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption. Bone resorption is the process of bone tissue dissolving through the action of specialized cells called osteoclasts. Monocytes and macrophages are precursors for osteoclast cells. One of the key signals in osteoclast formation is the Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa beta (NFkB ligand), also known as RANKL. This ligand plays a crucial role by binding to the RANK receptors found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages promoting differentiation of osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts will attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid that degrades the bone, causing osteolytic loosening. Different cell types are involved in the activation of bone resorption including osteoclasts, macrophages and fibroblasts, but it is not entirely known how neutrophils play a role in this process. Neutrophils are one of the first responders of the immune system in the presence of an antigen. They secrete many of the same cytokines as macrophages and fibroblasts that aid in osteoclast activation. It is unknown how neutrophils respond to the metals directly or if they induce an inflammatory response. This study seeks to provide more knowledge on neutrophil function in the presence of new metal alloys that could potentially be used for prosthetic implants. HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) will be exposed to titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V), and novel boron-titanium alloys. Upon exposure, phagocytosis activity will be analyzed"

The HL-60 cell line was differentiated into neutrophil-like cells using 1.25% DMSO and 1µM all-trans retinoic acid for 3 days. CD11Bb expression was analyzed in NLCs (A), NLCs with a 1:10 dilution of fluorescent beads for 24 hours (B), and NLCs with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescent beads for 24 hours."
