    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nMy name is Paloma Zarazua, a Master’s degree candidate at Cal Poly Pomona.\nMy research interests lie in immunology, hematopoietic cells, and solving biomedical problems. I’m especially curious about the organ shortage crisis and how it might be resolved through organogenesis—the process of forming organs. This topic fascinates me because researchers have discovered ways to use various plant tissues, like spinach leaves and bamboo, to create frameworks for cardiovascular tissue and bone structure. I hope to one day contribute to this area of research and help address the organ shortage. While we may never completely solve the problem, I believe that helping even a few patients receive an organ or shorten their wait time can make a lasting impact.\nBeyond research, I enjoy baking and creating new recipes. Before entering the lab, I never realized that baking was a science. When experiments in the lab failed, I found myself feeling similar to when my baking doesn’t turn out the way I anticipated. Whether I failed at making a pastry or an experiment, I kept trying until I succeeded. I’ve come to love it. I also enjoy tutoring and teaching. As a graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona, I’ve had the opportunity to teach students from diverse backgrounds in courses like Human Physiology, Life Science, and Foundations of Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity. I’ve also taught fellow lab members molecular techniques and tissue culture. As a future professor, I hope to continue supporting students and colleagues by fostering a strong, inclusive scientific community.\nMy career goal is to become a professor and run my own research lab focused on molecular biology techniques. I want to train future scientists and collaborate with medical teams working on organ-related challenges.\nOn this site, you’ll find updates on my research and my journey. I’ll be sharing more about my background, lab experiences, and the scientific questions that drive me.\n\n\n\n\n Connect with me on LinkedIn"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe demand for prosthetics has gradually increased with the need for implants and the advancements in technology, making them more accessible to the growing population in the United States. Prosthetic recipients have become increasingly younger over time, resulting in a longer duration of implant use among this demographic. The extended implant duration within the physiological environment in the body can result in corrosion of the metal alloy. Metal debris resulting from the corrosion can induce an inflammatory response that can lead to loosening of the implant due to bone resorption around the implant. Bone resorption is the process of bone tissue dissolving through the action of specialized bone remodeling cells called osteoclasts. Monocytes and macrophages are precursors for osteoclast cells. One of the key signals in osteoclast formation is the activation of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa  (RANK) on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells, by RANK ligand (RANKL) on other cells, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. This ligand plays a crucial role by binding to the RANK receptors found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages, promoting their differentiation into osteoclasts. Mature osteoclasts will attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrochloric acid that degrades the bone. When this phenomenon occurs on the periphery, it causes osteolytic loosening. Different cell types are involved in the activation of bone resorption, including osteoclasts, macrophages, and fibroblasts, but it is not entirely known how neutrophils play a role in this process. Neutrophils are one of the first responders of the immune system in the presence of an antigen. They secrete many of the same cytokines as macrophages and fibroblasts that aid in osteoclast activation. It is unknown whether neutrophils detect metal debris resulting from implant corrosion or whether they are induced into an inflammatory response. This study seeks to provide more knowledge on neutrophil function in the presence of new metal alloys that could potentially be used for prosthetic implants. HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs) were exposed to titanium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V), and novel titanium-boron alloys. Upon exposure, phagocytosis activity was analyzed along with inflammatory cytokine secretion using a cytometric bead array, and expression of NLC RANKL by flow cytometry. This is a comparative analysis of a series of metal alloys to determine which of them activates neutrophils the least, potentially making for a more biocompatible metal."

Reasons why many people obtain a prosthesis are due to amputations, age, injuries, and diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Prostheses nowadays can be made from a variety of metal alloys that each have benefits and disadvantages.\n\n\nB. History of Prosthesis\nProstheses have been used for a large portion of history. It is unknown when the first prosthetic was created, but the oldest known prosthesis that has been identified is from ancient Egypt. One toe was made from papier-mache but would not bend, while another toe was created using wood and leather (Figure 2). It was believed that prosthetics were created for cosmetic purposes rather than functionality. In Italy, at approximately 300 B.C., a prosthetic leg was made from bronze, hollowed wood, and leather straps. During the 16th century, the first functional prosthetic was created for soldiers who were coming off the battlefield1. During the American Civil War in 1860, the high number of amputees from the war caused a spike in prosthetic patents to quadruple. Figure 3 displays an artificial leg used by soldiers during the American Civil War. Throughout the 15th and 19th centuries, France and Switzerland began making prosthetics that were more functional by using cables, gears, and springs. Later in the 1900s, manufacturers were producing more functional prosthetics with more artificial materials like plastic, aluminum, titanium, and silicone to make the products lightweight and durable.\n\n\nC. Metals Used in Prosthesis\nAs technology has advanced through the ages, more alterations have been made for patients that aid in users’ needs, such as pain reduction, mobility, and independence2. Availability, cost, mechanical properties, and longevity must be part of the criteria for a successful prosthetic implant. Today, implant prosthetics are being made using materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and cobalt chrome 3. All metals used present a unique outcome due to the corrosion properties of the prosthetic after being implanted into a warm, wet, and salty environment, compounded by the natural movement of the body. Corrosion of such metal alloys may result in further complications for the user. These may include an inflammatory response that causes bone erosion, prosthetic failure, and the user receiving an entirely new prosthetic implant. Certain standards are required to establish a biocompatible metal. When metals are implanted into the patient, their positive charge is attracted to the negative charge of chloride ions in the human body. The chloride ions will pull titanium or iron or any positively charged metal out of the implant, leading to the accumulation of wear debris in the body. The free metal ions can also create harmful effects in surrounding tissues, including DNA damage. Moreover, high concentrations of metal ions have been shown to induce cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, etc., while minimal levels of metal concentration can initiate cytokine release.\nTitanium (Ti) is widely utilized for its exceptional biocompatibility, which significantly minimizes the risks of adverse reactions post-implantation surgery3. Upon exposure to physiological conditions, titanium forms a stable oxide layer on its surface, contributing to the enhancement of biocompatibility and promoting integration with surrounding tissues 4. The metal also exhibits favorable mechanical properties such as high strength and stiffness, making it suitable for load-bearing biomedical applications. The oxidation process is a key factor in its success as a biomaterial. However, titanium alone is relatively softer compared to titanium alloys. Titanium alloys, such as 90% Titanium- 6% Aluminum- 4% Vanadium (Ti6Al4V) are commonly used for prosthetic implants (Figure 4). For this alloy, once the superoxide layer is broken, the metal ions are attracted to the Cl ions, and the Ti ions escape through the fracture and into the body. The Ti ions bind to oxygen, creating TiO2 debris, which causes an immune response.(Figure 5). Newer titanium alloys may be a better option, analyzing them for more strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility overall.\nStainless steel is a metal alloy composed of chromium, nickel, and small amounts of molybdenum 5 6. This alloy possesses a high resistance to corrosion 7 and is commonly used in surgical implants8,9 (Figure 6). It has low strength and ductility but can be very expensive to make.\nCobalt Chrome is a very toxic metal alloy, but is also commonly used in medical implants due to its low chemical inertness and high corrosion resistance (Figure 7)10. The degradation through wear corrosion releases ions that can result in elevated levels of cobalt chrome in the body. Cobalt is highly toxic when concentrated at 7-10µg/L 3 or above. The wear can become toxic, creating an immune response and leading to osteolytic loosening. It affects the immune system, is a carcinogen, induces cardiotoxicity, and causes mutagenesis.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
