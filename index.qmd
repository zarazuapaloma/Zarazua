# Welcome to my website!

My name is **Paloma Zarazua**, and I hold a Master's degree in Biology from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. I am passionate about research and am pursuing opportunities in PhD programs or research roles.

My research explores how hematopoietic progenitor cells switch between protecting tissue and contributing to its unintended breakdown. I am fascinated by how these immune-derived cells sense their environment and coordinate responses that determine whether inflammation resolves or progresses to disease. Currently, I study how neutrophil-like cells respond to experimental metal alloys used in prosthetic implants, analyzing cytokine secretion and surface RANKL expression to identify the most biocompatible materials.

I am inspired by the intersection of immunology and biomaterials, and I aim to contribute to understanding how immune responses guide tissue repair, inflammation, and long-term medical outcomes. Beyond research, I mentor undergraduate students in the lab and have experience teaching biology courses, which reinforces my commitment to collaboration, communication, and cultivating future scientists.

Beyond research, I enjoy baking and creating new recipes. Before entering the lab, I never realized that baking was a science. When experiments in the lab failed, I found myself feeling similar to when my baking doesn't turn out the way I anticipated. Whether I failed at making a pastry or an experiment, I kept trying until I succeeded. I’ve come to love it. I also enjoy tutoring and teaching. As a graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona, I’ve had the opportunity to teach students from diverse backgrounds in courses like Human Physiology, Life Science, and Foundations of Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity. I’ve also taught fellow lab members molecular techniques and tissue culture. As a future professor, I hope to continue supporting students and colleagues by fostering a strong, inclusive scientific community.

I aspire to run my own research lab focused on immunology and hematopoietic cell signaling, training future scientists while contributing to biomedical research that addresses real-world health challenges.

On this site, you’ll find updates on my research and my journey. I’ll be sharing more about my background, lab experiences, and the scientific questions that drive me.
