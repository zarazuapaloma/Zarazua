# Welcome to my website!

My name is Paloma Zarazua, and I hold a Master’s degree in Biology from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. I am passionate about research and am currently pursuing opportunities in PhD programs or research roles.

My research explores how hematopoietic progenitor cells switch between protecting tissue and contributing to its unintended breakdown. I am particularly interested in how immune-derived cells sense their environment and coordinate responses that determine whether inflammation resolves or progresses to disease. Currently, I study how neutrophil-like cells respond to experimental metal alloys used in prosthetic implants, analyzing cytokine secretion and surface RANKL expression to identify the most biocompatible materials.

I am inspired by the intersection of immunology and biomaterials, and I aim to contribute to understanding how immune responses shape tissue repair, inflammation, and long-term medical outcomes. In addition to research, I mentor undergraduate students in the lab and have experience teaching biology courses, which reinforces my commitment to collaboration, communication, and cultivating future scientists.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy baking and creating new recipes—an unexpected passion that has deepened my appreciation for experimentation, persistence, and problem-solving. Much like research, baking involves iteration, failure, and refinement, and I’ve learned to embrace the process rather than fear mistakes. I also enjoy tutoring and teaching; as a graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona, I taught students from diverse backgrounds in courses including Human Physiology, Life Science, and Foundations of Biology. These experiences have strengthened my desire to support students through mentorship and inclusive teaching.

I aspire to lead my own research lab focused on immunology and hematopoietic cell signaling, training future scientists while contributing to biomedical research that addresses real-world health challenges.

On this site, you’ll find updates on my research journey, lab experiences, and the scientific questions that continue to drive my work.
